<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"Among the amusing and instructive books that remain to be written, one
of the most piquant would be a history of the criticism with which the
most celebrated literary productions have been greeted on their first
appearance before the world." It is quite possible that when Dr. William
Matthews began his essay on <i>Curiosities of Criticism</i> with these words,
he failed to grasp the full significance of that future undertaking. Mr.
Churton Collins recently declared that "a very amusing and edifying
record might be compiled partly out of a selection of the various
verdicts passed contemporaneously by reviews on particular works, and
partly out of comparisons of the subsequent fortunes of works with their
fortunes while submitted to this censorship." Both critics recognize the
fact that such a volume would be entertaining and instructive; but, from
another point of view, it would also be a somewhat doleful book. Even a
reader of meagre imagination and rude sensibilities could not peruse
such a volume without picturing in his mind the anguish and the
heart-ache which those bitter and often vicious attacks inflicted upon
the unfortunate victims whose works were being assailed.</p>

<p>Authors (particularly sensitive poets) have been at all times the sport
and plaything of the critics. Mrs. Oliphant, in her <i>Literary History of
England</i>, said with much truth: "There are few things so amusing as to
read a really 'slashing article'&mdash;except perhaps to write it. It is
infinitely easier and gayer work than a well-weighed and serious
criticism, and will always be more popular. The lively and brilliant
examples of the art which dwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> in the mind of the reader are
invariably of this class." Thus it happens that we remember the witty
onslaughts of the reviewers, and often ignore the fact that certain
witticisms drove Byron, for example, into a frenzy of anger that called
forth the most vigorous satire of the century; and others so completely
unnerved Shelley that he felt tempted to write no more; and still others
were so unanimously hostile in tone that Coleridge thought the whole
detested tribe of critics was in league against his literary success.
There were, of course, such admirable personalities as Wordsworth's&mdash;for
the most part indifferent to the strongest torrent of abuse; and clever
craftsmen like Tennyson, who, although hurt, read the criticisms and
profited by them; but, on the other hand, there are still well-informed
readers who believe that the <i>Quarterly Review</i> at least hastened the
death of poor Keats.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that such a volume of the "choice crudities of
criticism" as is here proposed would likewise fulfill the desirable
purpose of avenging the author upon his ancient enemy, the critic, by
showing how absurd the latter's utterances often are, and what a
veritable farrago of folly those collected utterances can make. We may
rest assured that however much hostile criticism may have pained an
author, it has never inflicted a permanent injury upon a good book. If
there appear to be works that have been thus more or less obscured, the
fault will probably be found not in the critic but in the works
themselves. According to this agreeable theory, which we would all fain
believe, the triumph of the ignorant or malevolent critic cannot endure;
sooner or later the author's merit will be recognized and he will come
into his own.</p>

<p>The present volume does not attempt to fulfill the conditions suggested
by Dr. Matthews and Mr. Collins. A history of contemporary criticism of
famous authors would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> be a more ambitious undertaking, necessitating an
extensive apparatus of notes and references. It seeks merely to gather a
number of interesting anomalies of criticism&mdash;reviews of famous poems
and famous poets differing more or less from the modern consensus of
opinion concerning those poems and their authors. Although most of the
chosen reviews are unfavorable, several others have been selected to
afford evidence of an early appreciation of certain poets. A few
unexpectedly favorable notices, such as the <i>Monthly Review's</i> critique
of Browning's <i>Sordello</i>, are printed because they appear to be unique.
The chief criterion in selecting these reviews (apart from the effort to
represent most of the periodicals and the principal poets between Gray
and Browning) has been that of interest to the modern reader. In most
cases, criticisms of a writer's earlier works were preferred as more
likely to be spontaneous and uninfluenced by his growing literary
reputation. Thus the volume does not attempt to trace the development of
English critical methods, nor to supply a hand-book of representative
English criticism; it offers merely a selection of bygone but readable
reviews&mdash;what the critics thought, or, in some cases, pretended to
think, of works of poets whom we have since held in honorable esteem.
The short notices and the well-known longer reviews are printed entire;
but considerations of space and interest necessitated excisions in a few
cases, all of which are, of course, properly indicated. The spelling and
punctuation of the original texts have been carefully followed.</p>

<p>The history of English critical journals has not yet been adequately
written. The following introduction offers a rapid survey of the
subject, compiled principally from the sources indicated in the
bibliographical list. I am indebted to Professor Felix E. Schelling of
the University of Pennsylvania, and to Dr. Robert Ellis Thompson and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
Professor Albert H. Smyth of the Philadelphia Central High School for
many suggestions that have been of value in writing the introduction.
Dr. Edward Z. Davis examined at my request certain pamphlets in the
British Museum that threw additional light upon the history of the early
reviews. Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach and Professor J.H. Moffatt read the proofs
of the introduction and notes respectively, and suggested several
noteworthy improvements.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>To the modern reader, with an abundance of periodicals of all sorts and
upon all subjects at hand, it seems hardly possible that this wealth of
ephemeral literature was virtually developed within the past two
centuries. It offers such a rational means for the dissemination of the
latest scientific and literary news that the mind undeceived by facts
would naturally place the origin of the periodical near the invention of
printing itself. Apart from certain sporadic manifestations of what is
termed, by courtesy, periodical literature, the real beginning of that
important department of letters was in the innumerable <i>Mercurii</i> that
flourished in London after the outbreak of the Civil War. Although the
<i>British Museum Catalogue</i> presents a long list of these curious
messengers and news-carriers, the only one that could be of interest in
the present connection is the <i>Mercurius Librarius; or a Catalogue of
Books Printed and Published at London</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> (1668-70), the contents of
which simply fulfilled the promise of its title.</p>

<p>Literary journals in England were, however, not a native development,
but were copied, like the fashions and artistic norms of that period,
from the French. The famous and long-lived <i>Journal des S&ccedil;avans</i> was
begun at Paris in 1665 by M. Denis de Sallo, who has been called, since
the time of Voltaire, the "inventor" of literary journals. In 1684
Pierre Bayle began at Amsterdam the publication of <i>Nouvelles de la
R&eacute;publique des Lettres</i>, which continued under various hands until
1718.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> These French periodicals were the acknowledged inspiration for
similar ventures in England, beginning in 1682 with the <i>Weekly Memorial
for the Ingenious: or an Account of Books lately set forth in Several
Languages, with some other Curious Novelties relating to Arts and
Sciences</i>. The preface stated the intention of the publishers to notice
foreign as well as domestic works, and to transcribe the "curious
novelties" from the <i>Journal des S&ccedil;avans</i>. Fifty weekly numbers appeared
(1682-83), consisting principally of translations of the best articles
in the French journal.</p>

<p>A few years later (1686), the Genevan theologian, Jean Le Clerc, then a
resident of London, established the <i>Universal Historical Biblioth&egrave;que;
or, an Account of most of the Considerable Books printed in All
Languages</i>, which was continued by various hands until 1693 in a series
of twenty-five quarto volumes. Contemporary with this review was a
number of similar publications which had for the most part a brief
existence. Among them was the <i>Athenian Mercury</i>, published on Tuesdays
and Saturdays (1691-1696), the <i>History of Learning</i>, which appeared for
a short time in 1691 and again in 1694; <i>Works of the Learned</i>
(1691-92); the <i>Young Student's Library</i> (1692) and its continuation,
the <i>Compleat Library</i> (1692-94); <i>Memoirs for the Ingenious</i> (1693);
the <i>Universal Mercury</i> (1694) and <i>Miscellaneous Letters, etc.</i>
(1694-96). Samuel Parkes includes among the reviews of this period Sir
Thomas Pope Blount's remarkable <i>Censura Celebrium Authorum</i> (1690).
That popular bibliographical dictionary of criticism (reprinted 1694,
1710 and 1718) is only remembered now for its omission of Shakespeare,
Spenser, Jonson and Milton from its list of "celebrated authors."
Neither that volume nor the same author's <i>De Re Poetica</i> (1694) finds a
proper place in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> list of periodicals. They should be grouped with such
works as Phillips' <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675) and Langbaine's <i>Account
of the English Dramatic Poets</i> (1691) among the more deliberate attempts
at literary criticism.</p>

<p>Between 1692-94 appeared the <i>Gentleman's Journal; or, the Monthly
Miscellany. Consisting of News, History, Philosophy, Poetry, Music,
Translations, etc.</i> This noteworthy paper, edited by Peter Anthony
Motteux while he was translating Rabelais, included among its
contributors Aphra Behn, Oldmixon, Dennis, D'Urfey and others. In many
ways it anticipated the plan of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (1731), which
has usually been accorded the honor of priority among English literary
magazines. The <i>History of the Works of the Learned; or, an Impartial
Account of Books lately printed in all Parts of Europe</i> was begun in
1699 and succumbed after the publication of its thirteenth volume
(1711). Among its editors was George Ridpath, who was afterwards
immortalized in Pope's <i>Dunciad</i>. The careers of the <i>Monthly
Miscellany</i> (1707-09) and <i>Censura Temporum</i> (1709-10) were brief. About
the same time an extensive series of periodicals was begun by a Huguenot
refugee, Michael De la Roche, who fled to England after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes and became an Episcopalian. After several years
of hack-work for the booksellers, he published (1710) the first numbers
of his <i>Memoirs of Literature, containing a Weekly Account of the State
of Learning at Home and Abroad</i>, which he continued until 1714 and for a
few months in 1717. In the latter year he began at Amsterdam his
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que Angloise</i> (1717-27), continued by his <i>Memoires
Litt&eacute;raires de la Grande Bretagne</i> (1720-1724) after the editorship of
the former had been placed in other hands on account of his pronounced
anti-Calvinistic views. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> Amsterdam, Daniel Le Clerc, a brother of the
Jean Le Clerc already mentioned, published his <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Chois&eacute;e</i>
(1703-14) and his <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Ancienne et Moderne</i> (1714-28). Both of
these periodicals suggested numerous ideas to De la Roche, who returned
to London and conducted the <i>New Memoirs of Literature</i> (1725-27). His
last venture was a <i>Literary Journal, or a Continuation of the Memoirs
of Literature</i>, which lasted about a year.</p>

<p>Contemporary with De la Roche, Samuel Jebb conducted <i>Bibliotheca
Literaria</i> (1722-24), dealing with "inscriptions, medals, dissertations,
etc." In 1728 Andrew Reid began the <i>Present State of the Republick of
Letters</i>, which reached its eighteenth volume in 1736. It was then
incorporated with the <i>Literary Magazine; or the History of the Works of
the Learned</i> (1735-36) and the joint periodical was henceforth published
as a <i>History of the Works of the Learned</i> until 1743. Other less
extensive literary journals of the same period were Archibald Bower's
<i>Historia Literaria</i> (1730-34); the <i>Bee; or, Universal Weekly Pamphlet</i>
(1733-35), edited by Addison's cousin, Eustace Budgell; the <i>British
Librarian, exhibiting a Compendious Review or Abstract of our most
Scarce, Useful and Valuable Books, etc.</i>, published anonymously by the
antiquarian William Oldys, from January to June, 1737, and much esteemed
by modern bibliophiles as a pioneer and a curiosity of its kind; a
<i>Literary Journal</i> (1744-49) published at Dublin; and, finally, the
<i>Museum; or the Literary and Historical Register</i>. This interesting
periodical printed essays, poems and reviews by such contributors as
Spence, Horace Walpole, the brothers Warton, Akenside, Lowth and others.
It was published fortnightly from March, 1746 to September, 1747, making
three octavo volumes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The periodicals enumerated thus far can hardly be regarded as literary
in the modern acceptation of the term; they were, for the most part,
ponderous, learned and scientific in character, and, with the exception
of the <i>Gentleman's Journal</i> and Dodsley's <i>Museum</i>, rarely ventured
into the domain of <i>belles-lettres</i>. An occasional erudite dissertation
on classical poetry or on the French canons of taste suggested a
literary intent, but the bulk of the journals was supplied by articles
on natural history, curious experiments, physiological treatises and
historical essays. During the latter half of the eighteenth century
theological and political writings, and accounts of travels in distant
lands became the staple offering of the reviews.</p>

<p>A new era in the history of English periodicals was marked by the
publication, on May 1, 1749, of the first number of the <i>Monthly
Review</i>, destined to continue through ninety-six years of varying
fortune and to reach its 249th volume. It bore the subtitle: <i>A
Periodical Work giving an Account, with Proper Abstracts of, and
Extracts from, the New Books, Pamphlets, etc., as they come out. By
Several Hands.</i> The publisher was Ralph Griffiths, who continued to
manage the review until his death in 1803. It seems remarkable that this
periodical which set the norm for half a century should have appeared
not only without preface or advertisement, but likewise without
patronage or support of any kind. From the first it reviewed poetry,
fiction and drama as well as the customary classes of applied
literature, and thus appealed primarily to the public rather than, like
most of its predecessors, to the learned. Its politics were Whig and its
theology Non-conformist. Griffiths was not successful at first, but
determined to achieve popularity by enlisting Ruffhead, Kippis,
Langhorne and several other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> minor writers on his critical staff. In
1757 Oliver Goldsmith became one of those unfortunate hacks as a result
of his well-known agreement with Griffiths to serve as an
assistant-editor in exchange for his board, lodging and "an adequate
salary." About a score of miscellaneous reviews from Goldsmith's
pen&mdash;including critiques of Home's <i>Douglas</i>, Burke's <i>On the Sublime
and the Beautiful</i>, Smollett's <i>History of England</i> and Gray's
<i>Odes</i>&mdash;appeared in the <i>Monthly Review</i> during 1757-58. The contract
with Griffiths was soon broken, probably on account of incompatibility
of temper. Goldsmith declared that he had been over-worked and badly
treated; but it is quite likely that his idleness and irregular habits
contributed largely to the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Tory rival and a champion of the Established Church had
appeared on the field. A printer named Archibald Hamilton projected the
<i>Critical Review: or, Annals of Literature. By a Society of Gentlemen</i>,
which began to appear in February, 1756, under the editorship of Tobias
Smollett and extended to a total of 144 volumes when it ceased
publication in 1817. Its articles were of a high order for the time and
the new review soon became popular. The open rivalry between the reviews
was fostered by an exchange of editorial compliments. Griffiths
published a statement that the <i>Monthly</i> was not written by "physicians
without practice, authors without learning, men without decency,
gentlemen without manners, and critics without judgment." Smollett
retorted that "the <i>Critical Review</i> is not written by a parcel of
obscure hirelings, under the restraint of a bookseller and his wife, who
presume to revise, alter and amend the articles occasionally. The
principal writers in the <i>Critical Review</i> are unconnected with
booksellers, unawed by old women, and independent of each other." Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
literary encounters did not fail to stimulate public interest in both
reviews and to add materially to their circulation.</p>

<p>When the first volume of the <i>Critical Review</i> was complete, the
"Society of Gentlemen" enriched it with an ornate, self-congratulatory
Preface in which they said of themselves:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"However they may have erred in judgment, they have declared their
thoughts without prejudice, fear, or affectation; and strove to
forget the author's person, while his works fell under their
consideration. They have treated simple dulness as the object of
mirth or compassion, according to the nature of its appearance.
Petulance and self-conceit they have corrected with more severe
strictures; and though they have given no quarter to insolence,
scurrility and sedition, they will venture to affirm, that no
production of merit has been defrauded of its due share of
applause. On the contrary, they have cherished with commendation,
the very faintest bloom of genius, even when vapid and unformed, in
hopes of its being warmed into flavour, and afterwards producing
agreeable fruit by dint of proper care and culture; and never,
without reluctance disapproved, even of a bad writer, who had the
least title to indulgence. The judicious reader will perceive that
their aim has been to exhibit a succinct plan of every performance;
to point out the most striking beauties and glaring defects; to
illustrate their remarks with proper quotations; and to convey
these remarks in such a manner, as might best conduce to the
entertainment of the public."</p></div>

<p>Moreover, these high ideals were entertained under the most unfavorable
circumstances. By the time the second volume was complete, the editors
took pleasure in announcing that in spite of "open assault and private
assassination," "published reproach and printed letters of abuse,
distributed like poisoned arrows in the dark," yea, in spite of the
"breath of secret calumny" and the "loud blasts of obloquy," the
<i>Critical Review</i> was more strongly entrenched than before.</p>

<p>There was more than mere rhodomontade in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> words. Not only did open
rivalry exist between the two reviews, but they were both made the
subject of violent attacks by authors whose productions had been
condemned on their pages. John Brine (1755), John Shebbeare (1757),
Horace Walpole (1759), William Kenrick (1759), James Grainger (1759) and
Joseph Reed (1759) are the earliest of the many writers who issued
pamphlets in reply to articles in the reviews. In 1759 Smollett was
tried at the King's Bench for aspersions upon the character of Admiral
Sir Charles Knowles published in the <i>Critical Review</i>. He was declared
guilty, fined &pound;100, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Yet in
spite of such difficulties, the <i>Critical Review</i> continued to find
favor among its readers. The articles written by its "Society of
Gentlemen" were on the whole far more interesting in subject and
treatment than the work of Griffiths' unfortunate hacks; but the
<i>Monthly</i> was also prospering, as in 1761 a fourth share in that review
was sold for more than &pound;755.</p>

<p>In 1760 appeared a curious anonymous satire entitled <i>The Battle of the
Reviews</i>, which presented, upon the model of Swift's spirited account of
the contest between ancient and modern learning, a fantastic description
of the open warfare between the two reviews. After a formal declaration
of hostilities both sides marshal their forces for the struggle. The
"noble patron" of the <i>Monthly</i> is but slightly disguised as the Right
Honourable Rehoboam Gruffy, Esq. His associates Sir Imp Brazen, Mynheer
Tanaquil Limmonad, Martin Problem, and others were probably recognized
by contemporary readers. To oppose this array the <i>Critical</i> summons a
force that contains only two names of distinction, Sampson MacJackson
and Sawney MacSmallhead (<i>i.e.</i>, Smollett). The ensuing battle, which is
described at great length,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> results in a victory for the <i>Critical
Review</i>, and the banishment of Squire Gruffy to the land of the
Hottentots.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson's well-known characterization of the two reviews was quite
just. On the occasion of his memorable interview (1767) with George III,
Johnson gave the King information concerning the <i>Journal des Savans</i>
and said of the two English reviews that "the <i>Monthly Review</i> was done
with most care; the <i>Critical</i> upon the best principles; adding that the
authors of the <i>Monthly Review</i> were enemies to the Church." Some years
later Johnson said of the reviews:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I think them very impartial: I do not know an instance of
partiality.... The Monthly Reviewers are not Deists; but they are
Christians with as little Christianity as may be; and are for
pulling down all establishments. The Critical Reviewers are for
supporting the constitution both in church and state. The Critical
Reviewers, I believe, often review without reading the books
through; but lay hold of a topick and write chiefly from their own
minds. The Monthly Reviewers are duller men and are glad to read
the books through."</p></div>

<p>Goldsmith's successor on the <i>Monthly</i> staff was the notorious libeller
and "superlative scoundrel," Dr. William Kenrick, who signalized his
advent (November, 1759) by writing an outrageous attack upon Goldsmith's
<i>Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe</i>. His
utterances were so thoroughly unjustified that Griffiths, who had scant
reason for praising poor Oliver, made an indirect apology for his
unworthy minion by a favorable though brief review (June, 1762) of <i>The
Citizen of the World</i>. During 1759 the <i>Critical Review</i> published a
number of Goldsmith's articles which probably enabled the impecunious
author to effect his removal from the garret in Salisbury Square to the
famous lodgings in Green Arbour Court. After March, 1760, we find no
record of his association with either review, al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>though he afterwards
wrote for the <i>British Magazine</i> and others.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the century several reviews appeared and
flourished for a time without serious damage to their well-established
rivals. The <i>Literary Magazine; or Universal Review</i> (1756-58) is
memorable for Johnson's co&ouml;peration and a half-dozen articles by
Goldsmith. Boswell tells us that Johnson wrote for the magazine until
the fifteenth number and "that he never gave better proofs of the force,
acuteness and vivacity of his mind, than in this miscellany, whether we
consider his original essays, or his reviews of the works of others."
The <i>London Review of English and Foreign Literature</i> (1775-80) was
conducted by the infamous Kenrick and others who faithfully maintained
the editor's well-recognized policy of vicious onslaught and personal
abuse. Paul Henry Maty, an assistant-librarian of the British Museum,
conducted for five years a <i>New Review</i> (1782-86), often called <i>Maty's
Review</i>, and dealing principally with learned works. It apparently
enjoyed some authority, but both Walpole and Gibbon spoke unfavorably of
Maty's critical pretensions. <i>The English Review; or, an Abstract of
English and Foreign Literature</i> (1783-96), extended to twenty-eight
volumes modelled upon the plan of the older periodicals. In 1796 it was
incorporated with the <i>Analytical Review</i> (1788) and survived under the
latter title until 1799. The <i>Analytical Review</i> deprecated the
self-sufficient attitude of contemporary criticism and advocated
extensive quotations from the works under consideration so that readers
might be able to judge for themselves. It likewise hinted at the tacit
understanding then existing between certain authors, publishers and
reviews for their mutual advantage, but which was arousing a growing
feeling of distrust on the part of the public. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> <i>British Critic</i>
(1793-1843) was edited by William Beloe and Robert Nares as the organ of
the High Church Party. This "dull mass of orthodoxy" concerned itself
extensively with literary reviews; but its articles were best known for
their lack of interest and authority. The foibles of the <i>British
Critic</i> were satirized in Bishop Copleston's <i>Advice to a Young
Reviewer</i> (1807) with an appended mock critique of Milton's <i>L'Allegro</i>.
In 1826 it was united with the <i>Quarterly Theological Review</i> and
continued until 1843.</p>

<p><i>The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine; or, Monthly Political and
Literary Censor</i> (1799-1821) played a strenuous r&ocirc;le in the troublous
times of the Napoleonic wars. It continued the policy of the
<i>Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner</i> (1797-98) conducted with such marked
vigor by William Gifford, but it numbered among its contributors none of
the brilliant men whose witty verses for the weekly paper are still read
in the popular <i>Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</i>. The <i>Review</i> was conducted
by John Richards Green, better known as John Gifford. Its articles were
at times sensational in character, viciously abusing writers of known or
suspected republican sentiments. From its pages could be culled a new
series of "Beauties of the Anti-Jacobin" which for sheer vituperation
and relentless abuse would be without a rival among such anthologies.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the principal reviews in
course of publication were the <i>Monthly</i>, the <i>Critical</i>, the <i>British
Critic</i>, and the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>. The latter was pre&euml;minently vulgar in
its appeal, the <i>Critical</i> had lost its former prestige, and the other
two had never risen above a level of mediocrity. There was more than a
lurking suspicion that these periodicals were, to a certain extent,
booksellers' organs, quite unreliable on ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>count of the partial and
biassed criticisms which they offered the dissatisfied public. The time
was evidently ripe for a new departure in literary reviews&mdash;for the
establishment of a trustworthy critical journal, conducted by capable
editors and printing readable notices of important books. People were
quite willing to have an unfortunate author assailed and flayed for
their entertainment; but they did not care to be deceived by laudatory
criticisms that were inspired by the publisher's name instead of the
intrinsic merits of the work itself.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when Francis Jeffrey, Henry Brougham and
Sydney Smith launched the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> in 1802, choosing a name
that had been borne in 1755-56 by a short-lived semi-annual review.
There were several significant facts associated with the new enterprise.
It was the first important literary periodical to be published beyond
the metropolis. It was the first review to appear quarterly&mdash;an interval
that most contemporary journalists would have condemned as too long for
a successful review. Moreover, it was conducted upon an entirely
different principle than any previous review; by restricting its
attention to the most important works of each quarter, it gave extensive
critiques of only a few books in each number and thus avoided the
multitude of perfunctory notices that had made previous reviews so
dreary and unreadable.</p>

<p>The idea of founding the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was apparently suggested by
Sydney Smith in March, 1802. Jeffrey and Francis Horner were his
immediate associates; but during the period of preparation Henry
Brougham, Dr. Thomas Brown, Dr. John Thomson and others became
interested. After some delay, the first number appeared on October 10,
1802, containing among its twenty-nine articles three by Brougham, five
by Horner, six by Jeffrey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> and nine by Smith. Although there was a
slight feeling of disappointment over the mild political tone of the new
review, its success was immediate. The edition of 750 copies was
speedily disposed of, and within a month a second edition of equal size
was printed. There was no regular editor at first, although the
publication of the first three numbers was practically superintended by
Smith. Afterwards Jeffrey became editor at a salary of &pound;300. He had
previously written some articles (including a critique of Southey's
<i>Thalaba</i>) for the <i>Monthly Review</i> and was pessimistic enough to
anticipate an early failure for the new venture. However, at the time he
assumed control (July, 1803) the circulation was 2500, and within five
years it reached 8,000 or 9,000 copies. Jeffrey's articles were
recognized and much admired; but the success of the <i>Edinburgh</i> was due
to its independent tone and general excellence rather than to the
individual contributions of its editor. Its prosperity enabled the
publishers to offer the contributors attractive remuneration for their
articles, thus assuring the co&ouml;peration of specialists and of the most
capable men of letters of the day. At the outset, ten guineas per sheet
were paid; later sixteen became the minimum, and the average ranged from
twenty to twenty-five guineas. When we recall that the <i>Critical Review</i>
paid two, and the <i>Monthly Review</i> sometimes four guineas per sheet, we
can readily understand the distinctly higher standard of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>.</p>

<p>Horner left Scotland for London in 1803 to embark upon a political
career. During the next six years occasional articles from his pen&mdash;less
than a score in all&mdash;appeared in the review. Smith and Brougham likewise
left Edinburgh in 1803 and 1805 respectively; but they ably supported
Jeffrey by sending numerous contributions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> for many years. During the
first quarter-century of the review's existence, this trio, with the
co&ouml;peration of Sir James Mackintosh and a few others, constituted the
mainstay of its success. Jeffrey's remarkable critical faculty was
displayed to best advantage in the wide range of articles (two hundred
in number) which he wrote during his editorship. It is true that his
otherwise sound judgment was unable to grasp the significance of the new
poetic movement of his day, and that his best remembered efforts are the
diatribes against the Lake Poets. Hence, in the eyes of the modern
literary dilettante, he figures as a misguided, domineering Zoilus whose
mission in life was to heap ridicule upon the poetical efforts of
Wordsworth, Coleridge and the lesser disciples of romanticism.</p>

<p>There are in the early volumes of the <i>Edinburgh</i> no more conspicuous
qualities than that air of vivacity and graceful wit, so thoroughly
characteristic of Sydney Smith. The reader who turns to those early
numbers may be disappointed in the literary quality of the average
article, for he will instinctively and unfairly make comparison with
more recent standards, instead of considering the immeasurably inferior
conditions that had previously prevailed; but we may safely assert that
the majority of Smith's articles can be read with interest to-day. He
was sufficiently sedate and serious when occasion demanded; yet at all
times he delighted in the display of his native and sparkling humor.
Although most of his important articles have been collected, far too
much of his work lies buried in that securest of literary
sepulchres&mdash;the back numbers of a critical review.</p>

<p>Henry Brougham at first wrote the scientific articles for the
<i>Edinburgh</i>. Soon his ability to deal with a wide range of subjects was
recognized and he proved the most versatile of the early reviewers. In
the first twenty num<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>bers are eighty articles from his pen. A story that
does not admit of verification attributes to Brougham a whole number of
the <i>Edinburgh</i>, including an article on lithotomy and another on
Chinese music. Later he became especially distinguished for his
political articles, and remained a contributor long after Jeffrey and
Smith had withdrawn. A comparatively small portion of his <i>Edinburgh</i>
articles was reprinted (1856) in three volumes.</p>

<p>Although the young men who guided the early fortunes of the review were
Whigs, the <i>Edinburgh</i> was not (as is generally believed) founded as a
Whig organ. In fact, the political complexion of their articles was so
subdued that even stalwart Tories like Walter Scott did not refrain from
contributing to its pages. Scott's <i>Marmion</i> was somewhat sharply
reviewed by Jeffrey in April, 1808, and in the following October
appeared the article by Jeffrey and Brougham upon Don Pedro Cevallos'
<i>French Usurpation of Spain</i>. The pronounced Whiggism of that critique
led to an open rupture with the Tory contributors. Scott, who was no
longer on the best terms with Constable, the publisher of the
<i>Edinburgh</i>, declared that henceforth he could neither receive nor read
the review. He proposed to John Murray&mdash;then of Fleet Street&mdash;the
founding of a Tory quarterly in London as a rival to the northern review
that had thus far enjoyed undisputed possession of the field, because it
afforded "the only valuable literary criticism which can be met with."
Murray, who had already entertained the idea of establishing such a
review, naturally welcomed the prospect of so powerful an ally. Like a
good Tory, Scott felt that the "flashy and bold character of the
<i>Edinburgh's</i> politics was likely to produce an indelible impression
upon the youth of the country." He ascertained that William Gifford,
formerly editor of the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> newspaper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> was willing to take
charge of the new review, which Scott desired to be not exclusively nor
principally political, but a "periodical work of criticism conducted
with equal talent, but upon sounder principle than that which had gained
so high a station in the world of letters."</p>

<p>In February, 1809, appeared the first number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.
Three of its articles were by Scott, who continued to contribute for
some time and whose advice was frequently sought by both editor and
publisher. Canning, Ellis, and others who had written for the then
defunct <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> became interested in the <i>Quarterly</i>; but the
principal contributors for many years were Robert Southey, John Wilson
Croker and Sir John Barrow. This trio contributed an aggregate of almost
five hundred articles to the <i>Quarterly</i>. In spite of its high standard,
the new venture was a financial failure for at least the first two
years; later, especially in the days of Tory triumph after the overthrow
of Napoleon, the <i>Quarterly</i> flourished beyond all expectation.
Gifford's salary as editor was raised from the original &pound;200 to &pound;900;
for many years Southey was paid &pound;100 for each article. Gifford was
distinctly an editor of the old school, with well-defined ideas of his
official privilege of altering contributed articles to suit himself&mdash;a
weakness that likewise afflicted Francis Jeffrey. While it appears that
Gifford wrote practically nothing for the review and that the savage
<i>Endymion</i> article so persistently attributed to him was really the work
of Croker, he was an excellent manager and conducted the literary
affairs of the <i>Quarterly</i> with considerable skill. His lack of system
and of business qualifications, however, resulted in the frequently
irregular appearance of the early numbers.</p>

<p>On account of his failing health, Gifford resigned the editorship of the
<i>Quarterly</i> in 1824, and was succeeded by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> John Taylor Coleridge, whose
brief and unimportant administration served merely to fill the gap until
an efficient successor for Gifford could be found. The choice fell upon
Scott's son-in-law, John Gibson Lockhart, who, from 1825 to 1853, proved
to be a most capable editor. The subsequent history of the review under
Whitwell Elwin (1853-1860), William Macpherson (1860-1867), Sir William
Smith (1867-1893), Mr. Rowland Prothero (1894-1899) and the latter's
brother, Mr. George Prothero, the present editor, naturally lies beyond
the purposes of this introduction.</p>

<p>The period of Lockhart's editorship of the <i>Quarterly</i> was likewise the
golden epoch of the <i>Edinburgh</i>. Sydney Smith's contributions ceased
about 1828. In the following year Jeffrey was elected Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates. He felt that the tenure of his new dignity
demanded the relinquishment of the editorship of an independent literary
and political review; accordingly, after editing the ninety-eighth
number of the <i>Edinburgh</i>, he retired in favor of Macvey Napier, who had
been a contributor since 1805. Napier conducted the review with great
success from 1829 until his death in 1847. His policy was to prefer
shorter articles than those printed when he assumed control. At first,
each number contained from fifteen to twenty-five articles; but the
growing length and importance of the political contributions had reduced
the average to ten. The return to the original policy naturally resulted
in a greater variety of purely literary articles.</p>

<p>Macaulay had begun his association with the <i>Edinburgh</i> by his
remarkable essay on <i>Milton</i> in 1825&mdash;a bold, striking piece of
criticism, full of the fire of youth, which established his literary
reputation and gave a renewed impetus to the already prosperous review.
Dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>ing Napier's editorship he contributed his essays on <i>Croker's
Boswell</i>, <i>Hampden</i>, <i>Burleigh</i>, <i>Horace Walpole</i>, <i>Lord Chatham</i>,
<i>Bacon</i>, <i>Clive</i>, <i>Hastings</i> and many others. Napier experienced some
difficulty in steering a middle course for the review between Lord
Brougham, who sought to use its pages to further his own political
ambitions, and Macaulay, who vigorously denounced the procedure. The
<i>Edinburgh</i> was no longer conspicuous among its numerous contemporaries;
but the literary quality was much higher than at first. Among the other
famous contributors of this period were Carlyle, John Stuart Mill,
Thackeray, Bulwer, Hallam, Sir William Hamilton and many others. This
was undoubtedly the greatest period in the history of the review. Its
power in Whig politics is shown by the fact that Lord Melbourne and Lord
John Russell sought to make it the organ of the government.</p>

<p>Napier's successor in 1847 was William Empson, who had contributed to
the <i>Edinburgh</i> since 1823 and who held the editorship until his demise
in 1852. Next followed Sir George Cornewall Lewis, who, however,
resigned in 1855 to become Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord
Palmerston's cabinet. During his r&eacute;gime he wrote less than a score of
articles for the review. His immediate successor was the late Henry
Reeve, whose forty years of faithful service until his death in 1895
brings the review practically to our own day. When Reeve began his
duties by editing No. 206 (April, 1855) Lord Brougham was the only
survivor of the contributors to the original number. In 1857, when a
discussion arose between editor and publisher concerning the
denunciatory attitude assumed by the review toward Lord Palmerston's
ministry, Reeve drew up a list of his contributors at that time,
including Bishop (afterwards Archbishop) Tait, George Grote,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> John
Forster, M. Guizot, the Duke of Argyll, Rev. Canon Moseley, George S.
Venables, Richard Monckton Milnes and a score of others&mdash;most of them
"names of the highest honour and the most consistent adherence to
Liberal principles." Within the four decades that followed, the
personnel of the review has made another almost complete change. A new
group of contributors, under the editorship of Hon. Arthur R.D. Elliot,
is now striving to maintain the standards of old "blue and yellow." A
caustic note in the (1890) Annual Index of <i>Review of Reviews</i> said of
the <i>Edinburgh</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has long since subsided into a respectable exponent of high and
dry Whiggery, which in these later days has undergone a further
degeneration or evolution into Unionism.... Audacity, wit,
unconventionality, enthusiasm&mdash;all these qualities have long since
evaporated, and with them has disappeared the political influence
of the <i>Edinburgh</i>."</p></div>

<p>The two great rivals which are now reaching their centenary<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> are still
the most prominent, in fact the only well-known literary quarterlies of
England. During their life-time many quarterlies have risen, flourished
for a time and perished. The <i>Westminster Review</i>, founded 1824, by
Jeremy Bentham, appeared under the editorship of Sir John Bowring and
Henry Southern. As the avowed organ of the Radicals it lost no time in
assailing (principally through the vigorous pens of James Mill and John
Stuart Mill) both the <i>Edinburgh</i> and the <i>Quarterly</i>. In 1836 Sir
William Molesworth's recently established <i>London Review</i> was united
with the <i>Westminster</i>, and, after several changes of joint title,
continued since 1851 as the <i>Westminster Review</i>. Since 1887 it has been
pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>lished as a monthly of Liberal policy and "high-class philosophy."
The <i>Dublin Review</i> (London, 1836) still continues quarterly as a Roman
Catholic organ; similarly the <i>London Quarterly Review</i>, a Wesleyan
organ, has been published since 1853. Of the quarterlies now defunct, it
will suffice to mention the dissenting <i>Eclectic Review</i> (1805-68) owned
and edited for a time by Josiah Conder; the <i>British Review</i> (1811-25);
the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i> (1819-68), which was a monthly during its
early history; the <i>Retrospective Review</i> (1820-26, 1853-54) conducted
by Henry Southern and afterwards Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas as a
critical review for old and curious books; the <i>English Review</i>
(1844-53); and the <i>North British Review</i> (1844-71), published at
Edinburgh. The impulse toward the study of continental literature during
the third decade of the century gave rise to the <i>Foreign Quarterly
Review</i> (1827-46); the <i>Foreign Review and Continental Miscellany</i>
(1828-30) and the <i>British and Foreign Review</i> (1835-44), continued as
the <i>British Quarterly Review</i> (1845-86).</p>

<p>A most determined effort to rival the older quarterlies resulted in the
<i>National Review</i>, founded in 1855 by Walter Bagehot and Richard Holt
Hutton. Its articles were exhaustive, well-written and thoroughly
characteristic of their class. In addition to the excellent work of both
editors, there were contributions by James Martineau, Matthew Arnold,
and Hutton's brother-in-law, William Caldwell Roscoe. Yet, in spite of
the high standards maintained until the end, the <i>National</i> ceased
publication in 1864. The many failures in this class of periodicals seem
to indicate quite clearly that the spirit of the age no longer favors a
quarterly. For our energetic and progressive era such an interval is too
long. The confirmed admirer of the elaborate essays of the <i>Edin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>burgh</i>
and the <i>Quarterly</i> will continue to welcome their bulky numbers; but
the average reader is strongly prejudiced in favor of the more frequent,
more attractive and more thoroughly entertaining monthlies.</p>

<p>It is one of the curiosities in the history of periodical literature
that no popular monthly developed during the first half of the
nineteenth century: the great quarterlies apparently usurped the entire
field. We have already seen that the <i>Critical Review</i> came to an end in
1817 whilst the <i>Monthly</i> continued until 1843. In both cases, however,
the publication amounted to little more than a sheer struggle for
existence. The <i>Monthly's</i> attempt to imitate in a smaller way the plan
of the quarterlies proved an unqualified failure. Neither of the two
periodicals established at the beginning of the century ever achieved a
position of critical authority. The <i>Christian Observer</i>, started (1802)
by Josiah Pratt and conducted by Zachary Macaulay until 1816, was
devoted mainly to the abolition of the slave-trade. Its subsequent
history until its demise in 1877 is confined almost wholly to the
theological pale. The second periodical was the <i>Monthly Repository of
Theology and General Literature</i> (1806-37), which achieved some literary
prominence for a time under the editorship of W.J. Fox. During the last
two years of its existence, Richard Hengist Horne and Leigh Hunt became
its successive editors, but failed to avert the final collapse.</p>

<p>It would be useless to enumerate the many short-lived attempts, such as
the <i>Monthly Censor</i> (1822) and Longman's <i>Monthly Chronicle</i> (1838-41)
that were made to provide a successful monthly review. The first of the
modern literary monthlies was the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, established in
1865, evidently upon the model of <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, which had
been published at Paris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> since 1831. Like the great French periodical,
it was issued fortnightly (at first) and printed signed articles. It was
Liberal in politics, agnostic in religion and abreast of the times in
science. The publishers, Messrs. Chapman and Hall, secured an
experienced editor in George Henry Lewes, who had contributed
extensively to most of the reviews then in progress. The success of the
new review was assured by the presence of such names as Walter Bagehot,
George Eliot, Sir John Herschel, Mr. Frederic Harrison and Herbert
Spencer on its list of contributors. It provided articles of timely
interest in politics, literature, art and science; in its early volumes
appeared serially Anthony Trollope's <i>Belton Estate</i> and Mr. George
Meredith's <i>Vittoria</i>.</p>

<p>Lewes edited the first six volumes, covering the years 1865-66. The
review was then made a monthly without, however, changing its now
inappropriate name, and the editorship was accepted by Mr. John Morley,
who conducted the <i>Fortnightly</i> with great success for sixteen years.
Most of the earlier contributors were retained; others like Mr.
Swinburne, J.A. Symonds, Professor Edward Dowden and (Sir) Leslie
Stephen established a standard of literary criticism that was
practically unrivalled. The authority of its scientific and political
writers was equally high; as for serial fiction, Mr. Morley published
Mr. Meredith's <i>Beauchamp's Career</i> and <i>The Tragic Comedians</i>, besides
less important novels by Trollope and others. More recently the
publication of fiction has been exceptional. The (1890) <i>Review of
Reviews</i> Index said of the <i>Fortnightly</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"While disclaiming 'party' or 'editorial consistency,' and
proclaiming that its pages were open to all views, the
<i>Fortnightly</i> seldom included the orthodox among its contributors.
The articles which startled people and made small earthquakes
beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> the crust of conventional orthodoxy, political and
religious, usually appeared in the <i>Fortnightly</i>. It was here that
Professor Huxley seemed to foreshadow the expulsion of the
spiritual from the world, by his paper on 'The Physical Basis of
Life,' and that Professor Tyndall propounded his famous suggestion
for the establishment of a prayerless union or hospital as a
scientific method for testing the therapeutic value of prayer. Mr.
Frederic Harrison chanted in its pages the praises of the Commune,
and prepared the old ladies of both sexes for the imminent advent
of an English Terror by his plea for Trade Unionism. It was in the
<i>Fortnightly</i> also that Mr. Chamberlain was introduced to the
world, when he was permitted to explain his proposals for Free
Labour, Free Land, Free Education, and Free Church. Mr. Morley's
papers on the heroes and saints (Heaven save the mark!) of the
French Revolution appeared here, and every month in an editorial
survey he summed up the leading features of the progress of the
world."</p></div>

<p>Since Mr. Morley's retirement in 1883, the editors of the <i>Fortnightly</i>
have been Mr. T.H.S. Escott (1883-86), Mr. Frank Harris (1886-94) and
the present incumbent, Mr. W.L. Courtney.</p>

<p>The <i>Fortnightly</i> was not long permitted to enjoy undisputed possession
of the field. In 1866, while it was still published semi-monthly, the
<i>Contemporary Review</i> was launched. Alexander Strahan, the publisher,
selected Dean Alford as its editor in order to assure a more reserved
tone than that of its popular predecessor. Although Liberal in politics,
like the <i>Fortnightly</i>, it assumed a very different and apparently
corrective attitude in religious matters. Most of its articles for many
years were upon theological subjects and were written by scholars
comparatively unknown to the public. The gradual change in policy
furthered by its later editors, especially Mr. James Knowles and Mr.
Percy Bunting has brought the <i>Contemporary</i> nearer to the general type
of popular monthlies. Its principles seem to tend toward "broad
evangelical, semi-socialistic Liberalism."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1877 Mr. Knowles found it impossible to conduct the <i>Contemporary</i>
any longer in the independent manner that seemed essential to him;
accordingly, he withdrew and established the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, which
in deference to the new era and a desire to be abreast of the times,
recently adopted the somewhat awkward title of the <i>Nineteenth Century
and After</i>. Like the <i>Fortnightly</i>, it presented a brilliant array of
names from the first. The initial number contained a Prefatory Sonnet by
Tennyson, and articles by Gladstone, Matthew Arnold, Cardinal Manning,
and the Dean of Gloucester and Bristol. It is sufficient to state that
this standard has since been maintained by Mr. Knowles and has made his
<i>Nineteenth Century and After</i> the most popular of the monthlies.</p>

<p>The <i>National Review</i> (not to be confounded with Bagehot and Hutton's
quarterly of that name), is the youngest and least important of the
monthly reviews. It was established in 1883 as a Conservative organ
under the editorship of Mr. Alfred Austin and Professor W.J. Courthope.
Well-known writers have contributed to its pages, yet it has never
assumed a place of first importance in the periodical world. Its present
editor is Mr. Louis J. Maxse.</p>

<p>It is well to bear in mind that these reviews all seek to discuss the
most important subjects of contemporary interest, and to secure the
services of writers best qualified to treat those subjects. In the
narrow sense of the term, they are not literary reviews; the function of
periodicals that discuss present day politics, sociology, theology,
history, science, art and numerous other generic subjects is more
inclusive and appeals to a much larger audience than the periodical of
literary criticism. In the quarterlies and monthlies we look for the
most authoritative reviews of the important books of the day; but for
general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> literary review and gossip, a new class of monthlies, best
represented by Dr. Robertson Nicoll's <i>Bookman</i> (1891) and the American
<i>Bookman</i> (1895) and <i>The Critic</i> (1881) has appeared. These fill a gap
between the more substantial monthlies and the very popular weekly
papers.</p>

<p>The last-mentioned class was practically developed during the nineteenth
century. The frequency of publication forbade a strict devotion to the
cause of <i>belles-lettres</i>; hence, in most cases, politics or music and
art were included in the scheme. At first literature was granted meagre
space in newspapers of the <i>Weekly Register</i> and <i>Examiner</i> type.
William Cobbett, profiting by his previous experience with <i>Porcupine's
Gazette</i> and the <i>Porcupine</i>, began his <i>Weekly Political Register</i> in
1802 and continued its publication until his death in 1835. It was so
thoroughly political in character that it hardly merits recognition as a
literary periodical. The <i>Examiner</i>, begun in 1808 by John Hunt, enjoyed
during the thirteen years of his brother Leigh's co&ouml;peration a wide
reputation for the excellence of its political and literary criticism.
Under Albany Fonblanque, John Forster and William Minto it continued
with varying success until 1880.</p>

<p>The first truly literary weekly review was the <i>Literary Gazette</i>,
established in 1817 by Henry Colburn, of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>,
under the joint editorship of Mr. H.E. Lloyd and Miss Ross. After the
first half-year of its existence, Colburn sold a third share to the
Messrs. Longman and another third to William Jerdan, who became sole
editor and eventually (1842) sole proprietor. The original price of a
shilling was soon reduced to eight pence. Jerdan set the prototype for
later literary weeklies in his plan, which embraced "foreign and
domestic correspondence, critical analyses of new publications,
varieties connected with polite literature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> philosophical researches,
scientific inventions, sketches of society, biographical memoirs, essays
on fine arts, and miscellaneous articles on drama, music and literary
intelligence." Thus Jerdan followed his friend Canning's advice by
avoiding "politics and polemics" and by aiming to present "a clear and
instructive picture of the moral and literary improvement of the times,
and a complete and authentic chronological literary record for general
reference." He secured the services of Crabbe, Barry Cornwall, Maginn,
Campbell, Mrs. Hemans and others: with such an array of contributors he
was able to crush the several rival weeklies that soon entered the
field.</p>

<p>Toward the end of its prosperous first decade, however, the misfortunes
of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> began. Colburn's publications had been roughly
handled in its pages and he accordingly aided James Silk Buckingham in
founding the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. The first number appeared on January 2, 1828,
as an evident rival of the older weekly. For a time the new venture was
on the verge of failure and the proprietors actually offered to sell it
to Jerdan. Within half a year Buckingham was succeeded by John Sterling
as editor. Frederic Denison Maurice's friends purchased the <i>Literary
Chronicle and Weekly Review</i> (begun 1819) and merged it with the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in July, 1828. For a year Sterling and Maurice contributed
some of the most brilliant critical articles that have appeared in its
pages. The working editor at that time was Henry Stebbing who had been
associated with the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> since its inception and who was the only
survivor<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> of the original staff when the semi-centennial number was
published on January 5, 1878.</p>

<p>Even the high standards set by Maurice and Sterling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> failed to win
public favor. The crisis came about the middle of 1830 when Charles
Wentworth Dilke became "supreme editor," enlisted Lamb, George Darley,
Barry Cornwall and others on his staff, and reduced the price of the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> from eightpence to fourpence. The apparent folly of reducing
the price and increasing the expenses did not lead to the generally
prophesied collapse; this first experiment in modern methods resulted in
the rapid growth of the <i>Athen&aelig;um's</i> circulation, to the serious
detriment of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>. Jerdan tried to stem the tide by
publishing lampoons on the dullness of Dilke's paper; but when the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> was enlarged in 1835 from sixteen to twenty-four pages
Dilke's triumph was evident. The <i>Literary Gazette</i> was compelled to
reduce its price to fourpence in its effort to regain the lost
subscriptions. Dilke labored earnestly to improve his paper and when, in
1846, he felt that it was established on a firm basis, he made Thomas
Kibble Hervey editor and devoted his own time to furthering his
journalistic enterprises. However, he continued to contribute to the
weekly; his valuable articles on Junius and Pope together with several
others were afterwards reprinted as <i>Papers of a Critic</i>.</p>

<p>Jerdan withdrew from the <i>Literary Gazette</i> in 1850. The hopeless
struggle with the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, involving a third reduction in price to
threepence, lasted until 1862, when the <i>Gazette</i> was incorporated with
the <i>Parthenon</i> and came to an end during the following year. Hervey
edited the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> until 1853 when ill-health necessitated his
resignation. The later editors include William Hepworth Dixon, Norman
MacColl and at present Mr. Vernon Rendall. After the withdrawal of Dixon
in 1869 a reformation in the staff and management of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> took
place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some old writers were parted with, and a great many fresh
contributors were found. While special departments, such as
science, art, music and the drama, were of necessity entrusted to
regular hands, indeed, the reviewing of books, now more than ever
the principal business of 'The Athen&aelig;um,' was distributed over a
very large staff, the plan being to assign each work to a writer
familiar with its subject and competent to deal with it
intelligently, but rigidly to exclude personal favouritism or
prejudice, and to secure as much impartiality as possible. The rule
of anonymity has been more carefully observed in 'The Athen&aelig;um'
than in most other papers. Its authority as a literary censor is
not lessened, however, and is in some respects increased, by the
fact that the paper itself, and not any particular critic of great
or small account, is responsible for the verdicts passed in its
columns." (Fox Bourne.)</p></div>

<p>Half a year after the inception of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, the first number of
the <i>Spectator</i> was issued (July 6, 1828) by Robert Stephen Rintoul, an
experienced journalist who had launched the ill-fated semi-political
<i>Atlas</i> two years before and therefore decided to confine his new
venture to literary and social topics. The political excitement of the
time soon aroused Rintoul's interest, and he undertook the advocacy of
the Reform Bill with all possible ardor. From him emanated the famous
battle-cry: "The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill." He
conducted the <i>Spectator</i> with great skill until 1858, when he sold it
two months before his death. Although he wrote little for its pages,
Rintoul made the <i>Spectator</i> a power in furthering all reforms. The
literary standard, while somewhat obscured for a time by its politics,
was high. In 1861 the <i>Spectator</i> passed into the hands of Mr. Meredith
Townsend who sold a half share to the late Richard Holt Hutton with the
understanding that they should act as political and literary editors
respectively. During the four years of the American Civil War, the
<i>Spectator</i> espoused the cause of the North and was con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>sequently
unpopular; but the outcome turned the sentiment in England and likewise
the fortunes of the <i>Spectator</i>. Hutton's contributions included his
most memorable utterances upon theological and literary subjects. In the
midst of religious controversy he was able to discuss delicate questions
without giving offense, to enlist all parties by refraining from
expressed allegiance to one. The <i>Spectator</i> of Hutton's day was, in
Mrs. Oliphant's opinion, "specially distinguished by the thoughtful tone
of its writing, the almost Quixotic fairness of its judgments, and the
profoundly religious spirit which pervades its more serious articles."
Hutton retired shortly before his death in 1897. The present editor is
Mr. J. St. Loe Strachey.</p>

<p>The <i>Saturday Review</i> was established in November, 1855, by A.J.
Beresford Hope. Its first editor was John Douglass Cook, who had indexed
the early volumes of the <i>Quarterly</i> for Murray and had gained his
journalistic experience with the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.
Though possessed of no great personal ability, Cook had the useful
editorial faculty of recognizing talent, and consequently gathered about
himself the most promising writers of the younger generation, including,
among others, Robert Talbot Cecil, the late Lord Salisbury. The
<i>Saturday Review</i> at once became the most influential and most energetic
of the weekly papers. Its politics, independent at first, later assumed
a pronounced Conservative complexion. Cook remained editor until his
death (1868) when he was succeeded by his assistant, Philip Harwood.
Since the latter's retirement in 1883 the more recent editors include
Mr. Walter H. Pollock, Mr. Frank Harris and the present incumbent, Mr.
Harold Hodge. Professor Saintsbury wrote of the <i>Saturday Review</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Its staff was, as a rule, recruited from the two Universities
(though there was no kind of exclusion for the unmatriculated; as a
matter of fact, neither of its first two editors was a son either
of Oxford or Cambridge), and it always insisted on the necessity of
classical culture.... It observed, for perhaps a longer time than
any other paper, the salutary principles of anonymity (real as well
as ostensible) in regard to the authorship of particular articles;
and those who knew were constantly amused at the public mistakes on
this subject."</p></div>

<p>Such "salutary principles of anonymity" were not observed by the
<i>Academy, a Monthly Record of Literature, Learning, Science and Art</i>,
which began to appear in October, 1869, and was published for a short
time by John Murray. Its founder, Dr. Charles E. Appleton, edited the
<i>Academy</i> until his death in 1879. All the leading articles bore the
authors' signatures, and, following the example of the more ambitious
monthlies, Dr. Appleton secured the best known writers as contributors.
The first number opened with an interesting unpublished letter of Lord
Byron's; its literary articles were by Matthew Arnold, Gustave Masson
and Mr. Sidney Colvin, theology was represented by the Rev. T.K. Cheyne
and J.B. Lightfoot (later Bishop of Durham), science by Thomas Huxley
and Sir John Lubbock (now Lord Avebury), and classical learning by Mark
Pattison and John Conington. This remarkable array of names did not
diminish in subsequent numbers. Besides those mentioned Mr. W.M.
Rossetti, Max M&uuml;ller, G. Maspero, J.A. Symonds, F.T. Palgrave and others
contributed to the first volume. Later such names as William Morris,
John Tyndall, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater and Robert Louis
Stevenson appeared in its pages.</p>

<p>In spite of its brilliant program, the size of the <i>Academy</i>, even at
its price of sixpence, was too slight to rank as a monthly. After four
years' experience, first as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> monthly, then as a fortnightly, it became
and has remained a weekly. The editorial succession since the death of
Dr. Appleton has been C.E. Doble (1879-81); Mr. James Sutherland Cotton
(1881-96); Mr. C. Lewis Hind (1896-1903); and Mr. W. Teignmouth Shore.
The issue of November 7, 1896, announced Mr. Cotton's retirement and the
inauguration of a new policy, which, in addition to technical
improvements, promised the issue of occasional supplements of a purely
academic and educational character, and the beginning of the series of
<i>Academy Portraits</i> of men of letters. At the same time the publication
of signed articles was abolished and the <i>Academy</i> remained anonymous
until the recent editorial change. A new departure in October, 1898,
made the <i>Academy</i> an illustrated paper&mdash;the most attractive though not
the most authoritative of the weeklies. It has departed widely from the
set traditions of Dr. Appleton, but most readers will agree that the
departure has been justified by the needs of the hour. There is small
satisfaction in reading a one-page review from the pen of an Arnold or a
Pater; we feel that such authorities should express themselves at length
in the pages of the literary monthlies; that the reader of the weekly
should be content with the anonymous (and less expensive) review written
by the staff-critic. Whatever the personal bias, it is at least certain
that under present conditions the <i>Academy</i> appeals more generally to
the popular taste. Its recent absorption of a younger periodical is
indicated in the compounding of its title into the <i>Academy and
Literature</i>&mdash;a change that does not commend itself on abstract grounds
of literary fitness and tradition.</p>

<p>A consideration of periodicals of the <i>Tatler</i>, <i>Spectator</i> and
<i>Rambler</i> class evidently lies beyond our present purpose; though
Addison's papers on <i>Paradise Lost</i> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span> similar articles show an
occasional critical intent. The magazines, however, have in various
instances shown such an extensive interest in matters literary that a
brief account of their development will not be amiss. The primary
distinction between the review and the magazine is well understood; the
former criticizes, the latter entertains. Hence fiction, poetry and
essays are better adapted than book-reviews to the needs of the literary
magazine. As already stated, Peter Motteux's <i>Gentleman's Journal</i>
(1692-94) probably deserves recognition as the first English magazine,
though its brief career is forgotten in the honor accorded to the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, established in 1731 by Edward Cave and which,
still under the editorship of "Sylvanus Urban, Gentleman," is now
approaching its three hundredth volume. In the early days its lists of
births, deaths, marriages, bankrupts, events, etc., must have made it a
useful summary for the public. In literature it printed merely a
"Register of New Books" without comment of any sort. It is exasperating
to find such books as <i>Pamela</i> or <i>Tom Jones</i> listed among "New
Publications" without a word of criticism or commendation. We could
spare whole reams of pages devoted to "Army Promotions" and "Monthly
Chronicle" for a few lines of literary review.</p>

<p>Although the booksellers refused to aid Cave in establishing his
magazine, the demonstration of its success brought forth numerous
rivals. As they all followed Cave's precedent in ignoring literary
criticism, it will suffice to mention merely the names of the <i>London
Magazine</i> (1732-79); the <i>Scots Magazine</i> (1739-1817), continued as the
<i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> until 1826; the <i>Universal Magazine</i> (1743-1815);
the <i>British Magazine</i> (1746-50); the <i>Royal Magazine</i> (1759-71); and
finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span> the <i>British Magazine, or Monthly Repository for Gentlemen and
Ladies</i> (1760-67) edited by Tobias Smollett, who published his <i>Sir
Launcelot Greaves</i> in its pages&mdash;perhaps the first instance of the
serial publication of fiction. Goldsmith wrote some of his most
interesting essays for Smollett's magazine.</p>

<p>An important addition to the ranks was the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> begun in
1796 by Sir Richard Phillips under the editorship of John Aikin. The
principal contributor was William Taylor of Norwich who, during a period
of thirty years, supplied to the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> and other
periodicals a series of 1,750 articles of remarkable quality. His
contributions gave the Magazine standing as a literary review. Hazlitt
accorded to Taylor the honor of writing the first reviews in the style
afterwards adopted by the Edinburgh Reviewers, which established their
reputations as original and impartial critics. He is remembered to-day
as the author of an unread <i>Historic Survey of German Poetry</i> which was
vigorously assailed by Carlyle in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. The <i>New
Monthly Magazine</i> was started in 1814 by Henry Colburn and Frederick
Shoberl in opposition to Phillips' magazine. Its first editors were Dr.
Watkins and Alaric A. Watts. At a later time Campbell, Bulwer, Theodore
Hook and Harrison Ainsworth successively assumed charge. Under such
capable direction the magazine naturally won a prominent place among the
periodicals of the day. During its later years the <i>New Monthly</i> was
obscured by more ambitious ventures and came to an inglorious end in
1875&mdash;thirty-two years after the suspension of Phillips' <i>Monthly
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>A most significant event in the history of the magazine was the founding
of the <i>Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</i> in April, 1817, by William
Blackwood. The new magazine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> was projected to counteract the influence
of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, but under its first editors, James Cleghorn
and Thomas Pringle, it failed to win favor. After six numbers were
issued, a final disagreement between Blackwood and the editors resulted
in the withdrawal of the latter. The name of the monthly was changed to
<i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>&mdash;popularly <i>Blackwood's</i> or "Maga"&mdash;and
henceforth until his death Blackwood was his own editor. John Wilson
(Christopher North) and John Gibson Lockhart, the most important of the
early contributors to <i>Blackwood's</i>, published in that famous seventh
number the clever <i>Chaldee Manuscript</i>&mdash;an audacious satire upon the
original editors, the rival publisher Constable, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
and various literary personages under a thinly veiled allegory in
apocalyptic style. It at once attracted wide attention (including a
costly action for libel within a fortnight) and was suppressed in the
second impression of the number. The same number of <i>Blackwood's</i> set
the precedent for the subsequent critical vituperation that made the
magazine notorious. It contained an abusive article on Coleridge's
<i>Biographia Literaria</i> and the first of a series of virulent attacks on
"The Cockney School of Poetry." Much of the literary criticism in the
first few volumes is inexcusably brutal; fortunately, <i>Blackwood's</i> soon
became less rampant in its critical outbursts. The co&ouml;peration of James
Hogg and the ill-fated Maginn introduced new articles of varied
interest, particularly the witty letters and the parodies of "Ensign
O'Doherty." Wilson's <i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i> became a characteristic feature
of <i>Blackwood's</i>; John Galt and Susan Ferrier won popularity among the
novel readers of the day; and in the trenchant literary criticism of
Lockhart, Wilson, Hogg and their confr&egrave;res an equally high standard was
maintained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span></p>

<p>After the death of the elder Blackwood in 1834, the management of the
magazine passed to his sons successively. John Blackwood, the sixth son,
enjoyed the distinction of "discovering" George Eliot and beginning, by
the publication of her <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> in 1857, a relationship
that was both pleasant and profitable to the firm. A few years earlier
appeared the first contributions of another remarkable literary
woman&mdash;Mrs. Margaret Oliphant, whose association with <i>Blackwood's</i>
lasted over forty years. Her history of the house of Blackwood was
published in the year of her death (1897).</p>

<p><i>Blackwood's</i> is still a strong conservative organ. The already quoted
Index of the <i>Review of Reviews</i> says of it: "With a rare consistency it
has contrived to appear for over three score years and ten as a spirited
and defiant advocate of all those who are at least five years behind
their time. Sometimes <i>Blackwood</i> is fifty years in the rear, but that
is a detail of circumstance. Five or fifty, it does not matter, so long
as it is well in the rear." Such gentle sarcasm merely emphasizes the
fact that <i>Blackwood's</i> has always aimed to be more than a magazine of
<i>belles-lettres</i>. The publishers celebrated the appearance of the one
thousandth number in February, 1899, by almost doubling its size to a
volume of three hundred pages, including a latter-day addition to the
<i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i> and other features.</p>

<p>An important though short-lived venture was the <i>London Magazine</i>, begun
in January, 1820, under the editorship of John Scott. By its editorial
assaults upon the <i>Blackwood</i> criticisms of the "Cockney School," it
became the recognized champion of that loosely defined coterie. The
initial attack in the May number was further emphasized by more vigorous
articles in November and Decem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>ber of 1820, and January, 1821. Lockhart,
who was the recipient of the worst abuse, demanded of Scott an apology
or a hostile meeting. The outcome of the controversy was a duel on
February 16th between Scott and Lockhart's intimate friend, Jonathan
Henry Christie. Scott was mortally wounded, and died within a fortnight;
the verdict of wilful murder brought against Christie and his second at
the inquest resulted in their trial and acquittal at the old Bailey two
months later. It would have been well for the <i>London Magazine</i> and for
literature in general if that unfortunate duel could have been prevented
or at least diverted into such a ludicrous affair as the meeting between
Jeffrey and Tom Moore in 1806.</p>

<p>The most famous contributions to the <i>London Magazine</i> during Scott's
r&eacute;gime were Lamb's <i>Essays of Elia</i>. Those charming productions, now
ranked among our dearly treasured classics, were not received at first
with universal approbation. The long and justly forgotten Alaric A.
Watts said of them: "Charles Lamb delivers himself with infinite pain
and labour of a silly piece of trifling, every month, in this Magazine,
under the signature of Elia. It is the curse of the Cockney School that,
with all their desire to appear exceedingly off-hand and ready with all
they have to say, they are constrained to elaborate every sentence, as
though the web were woven from their own bowels. Charles Lamb says he
can make no way in an article under at least a week." In July, 1821, the
<i>London Magazine</i> was purchased by Taylor and Hessey. Although Thomas
Hood was made working-editor, the <i>Blackwood</i> idea of retaining
editorial supervision in the firm was followed. Within a few months De
Quincey contributed his <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>&mdash;the
most famous of all the articles that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span> appeared in the magazine. Lamb<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
and De Quincey continued to write for the magazine for several years.
Other contributors, especially of literary criticism, were Barry
Cornwall, Carlyle, Hazlitt, Henry Cary and, toward the end, Walter
Savage Landor. The magazine became less conspicuous after 1824 and
dragged out an obscure existence until 1829; but it is probable that no
other periodical achieved the standard of purely literary excellence
represented by the <i>London Magazine</i> during the first five years of its
existence.</p>

<p>In February, 1830, James Fraser published the first number of <i>Fraser's
Magazine for Town and Country</i>. The magazine was not named after the
publisher but after its sponsor, Hugh Fraser, a "briefless barrister"
and man about town. The latter enlisted the aid of Maginn who had
severed his connection with <i>Blackwood's</i> in 1828. In general,
<i>Fraser's</i> was modelled upon <i>Blackwood's</i>; but a unique and popular
feature was the publication of the "Gallery of Illustrious Literary
Characters" between 1830-38. This famous series of eighty-one caricature
portraits chiefly by Daniel Maclise, with letter-press by Maginn, has
been made accessible to present-day readers in William Bates' <i>Maclise
Portrait Gallery</i> (1883) where much illustrative material has been added
to the original articles. It is evident that the literary standard of
<i>Fraser's</i> soon equalled and possibly surpassed that of <i>Blackwood's</i>.
Among its writers were Carlyle (who contributed a critique to the first
number, published <i>Sartor Resartus</i> in its pages, 1833-35, and, as late
as 1875, his <i>Early Kings of Norway</i>), Thackeray, Father Prout and
Thomas Love Peacock. Maclise's plate of "The Fraser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>ians" also includes
Allan Cunningham, Theodore Hook, William Jerdan, Lockhart, Hogg,
Coleridge, Southey and several others. It is unlikely that all of them
wrote much for <i>Fraser's</i>; but the staff was undoubtedly a brilliant
assemblage. James Anthony Froude became editor in 1860 and was assisted
for a time by Charles Kingsley and Sir Theodore Martin. He was succeeded
by his sub-editor, William Allingham, during whose administration
(1874-79) the fortunes of <i>Fraser's</i> suffered a decline. The gradual
failure was due to the competition of the new shilling magazines rather
than to incompetence on the part of the editor. The end came in October,
1882, when <i>Fraser's</i> was succeeded by <i>Longman's Magazine</i> which is
still in progress.</p>

<p>The magazines established soon after <i>Fraser's</i> followed for the most
part a policy that demands for them mere passing mention in the present
connection. Literary criticism and reviews were largely abandoned in
favor of lighter and more entertaining material. The <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i> (1833-80) and <i>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</i> (1832-61) best
represent the transitional stage. During its early history, the latter
employed prominent contributors, who gave it an important position. Such
magazines as the <i>Metropolitan</i> (1831-50) and <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>
(1837-68) set the standards for similar periodicals since that time.
Charles Dickens' experience with <i>Bentley's</i> led to the publication of
his weeklies, <i>Household Words</i> (1850 to date) and <i>All the Year Round</i>
(1859), which was incorporated in 1895 with the former. <i>Macmillan's
Magazine</i>, first of the popular shilling monthlies, began in 1859 and
was soon followed by Thackeray's <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> (1860) and <i>Temple
Bar</i> (1860). All of these magazines are still in progress. The
occasional publication of an article by a literary critic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span> hardly
justifies their inclusion within the category of critical reviews, as
their essential purpose is to instruct and entertain, rather than to sit
in judgment upon contemporary letters.</p>

<p>There are in course of publication to-day numerous literary periodicals
of varying scope and importance that have not even been mentioned by
title in our hasty survey. Enough has been said, however, to give some
idea of the magnitude of the field, and to show that most of the great
names of modern English literature have been more or less closely
associated with the history of the literary reviews. Those reviews have
usually sought to foster all that is highest and best in our
intellectual development; and although English literary criticism has
been, on the whole, less convincing, less brilliant and less
authoritative than that of France, it has during the past century set a
fairly high standard of excellence. It seems difficult to understand why
the literary conditions in England, instead of developing critics like
Sainte-Beuve, Gaston Paris, Bruneti&egrave;re and others whose utterances
redound to the lasting glory of French criticism, should be steadily
tending toward a lower and less influential level. Mr. Churton Collins
in his pessimistic discussion of "The Present Functions of Criticism"
deplores the spirit of tolerance and charity manifested toward the
mediocre productions of contemporary writers; he attributes the
degradation of criticism to the lack of critical standards and
principles, and indirectly to the neglect of the study of literature at
the English Universities. The plea for an English Academy has been made
at different times and with different ends in view, but under modern
conditions such an institution would hardly solve the problem. Mr.
Collins shows how the intellectual aristocracy of the past has been
superseded by the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span> omnivorous reading-public afflicted with a
perpetual craving for literary novelty. The inevitable rapidity of
production results in a deluge of poor books which are foisted upon
readers by a "detestable system of mutual puffery." This condition of
affairs naturally offers few opportunities for the development of
critical ideals; but it hardly applies to the incorruptible reviews of
recognized standing. The reasons for the lack of authority in modern
English criticism are more deeply grounded in an inherent objection to
the restraint imposed upon an artist by artificial canons of taste, and
in a well-founded impression that many of the greatest literary
achievements evince a violation of such canons.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that criticism is thereby disdained and
disregarded. The critical dicta of a Dryden or a Johnson, a Coleridge or
a Hazlitt, and, more recently, an Arnold or a Pater, are valued and
studied because they emphasize the vital elements essential to the
proper appreciation of a literary product; and, moreover, because such
critics, in transcending the limitations of their kind, establish higher
and juster standards for the criticism of the future. On the other hand,
the great majority of critical utterances must necessarily be ephemeral;
they may exert considerable contemporary influence, but are usually
forgotten long before the works that called them forth. Unless this
criticism is more than a perfunctory examination of the merits and
defects of the work under consideration, it cannot endure beyond its own
brief day.</p>

<p>Several fruitless attempts have been made to reduce criticism to an
exact science, which, quite disregarding the factor of personal taste,
could refer all literature to a more or less fixed and arbitrary set of
critical principles. The champions of this objective criticism point to
the occasionally ludicrous divergence of the views expressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span> in
criticism of certain poets or novelists, and insist that there is no
occasion for such a bewildering difference of opinion. They seem to
forget that the criticism which we esteem most highly at all times is
the subjective criticism in which the personality of a competent and
sincere critic is manifest. Literature, like music, painting and the
other arts, has its own laws of technique&mdash;fundamental canons that must
be observed in the successful pursuit of the art; but at a certain point
difference of opinion is not only possible but profitable. The critics
who would unite in condemning a thirteen-line sonnet or a ten-act
tragedy could not be expected to agree on the relative merits of
Milton's and Wordsworth's sonnets. Unanimity of opinion is as impossible
and undesirable concerning the poetic achievement of Browning and
Whitman as it is concerning the music of Brahms and Wagner, or the
painting of Turner and Whistler. Great artists who have taken liberties
with traditions and precedents have done much to prevent the critics
from falling into a state of self-complacency over their scientific
methods and formulas.</p>

<p>The most helpful form of criticism is the interpretative variety, not
necessarily the laudatory "appreciation" that is so popular in our day,
but an honest effort to understand and elucidate the intention of the
writer. The proper exercise of this art occasionally demands rare
qualifications on the part of the critic; at the same time it adds
dignity to his calling and value to his utterance. It serves to dispel
the popular conception of a critic as a disappointed <i>litterateur</i> who
begrudges his more brilliant fellow craftsmen their success and who dogs
their triumphs with his ill-tempered snarling. Interpretative criticism
needs few rules and no system; yet it serves a noble purpose as a guide
and monitor for subsequent literary effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of anonymous criticism has occasioned much thoughtful
discussion. In former times anonymity was often a shield for the
slanderer who saw fit to abuse and assail his victim with the rancorous
outburst of his malice; but it is also clear that the earlier reviewers
were mere literary hacks whose names would have given no weight to the
critique and hence could be omitted without much loss. The authorship of
important <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly</i><a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> articles in the days of their
greatness was usually an open secret. Later periodicals, like the
<i>Fortnightly</i> and the <i>Academy</i> found it a profitable advertisement to
publish the signatures of their eminent critics. The tendency of the
present day is largely in favor of anonymity; no longer as a cover for
the dispensation of malicious vituperation, but as a necessary
safe-guard for the unbiased and untrammeled exercise of the critical
function. Certain abuses of the privilege are inevitable. Mr. Sidney
Colvin in looking over the criticisms of Mr. Stephen Phillips' poetry
recently discovered in three periodicals convincing parallels that led
Mr. Arthur Symons to confess to the authorship of all three critiques.
The average reader would in most cases be strongly influenced by the
united verdict of the critics of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
and the <i>Quarterly Review</i>; in this instance his convictions would
undoubtedly be rudely shattered when he learned the truth. Under such
conditions anonymous criticism is a menace, not an aid to the reader's
judgment.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it must be borne in mind that criticism is not an end but
a means to an end. All the literary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span> criticism ever uttered would be
useless as such if it did not evince a desire to further the development
of literary art. The <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>&#338;dipus</i> were written long
before Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, and it is not likely that either Homer or
Sophocles would have been a greater poet if he could have read the
Stagirite's treatise. Yet the <i>Poetics</i>, as a summary of the essential
features of that art, served an important purpose in later ages and
exerted far-reaching influences. Criticism in all ages has necessarily
been of less importance than art itself&mdash;it guides and suggests, but
cannot create. Literary history shows that true criticism must be in
conformity with the spirit of the age; it cannot oppose the trend of
intelligent opinion. It may praise, censure, advise, interpret&mdash;but it
will always remain subservient to the art that called it forth. There is
no reason to believe that criticism can ever be established in the
English-speaking world upon a basis that will subject to an arbitrary
and irrevocable ruling the form and spirit of the artist's message to
mankind.</p>

<h2>EARLY REVIEWS OF ENGLISH POETS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Thomas Gray</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap lowercase">ODES.</span> <i>By Mr.</i> Gray. 4to. 1s. Dodsley.</p>

<p>As this publication seems designed for those who have formed their taste
by the models of antiquity, the generality of Readers cannot be supposed
adequate Judges of its merit; nor will the Poet, it is presumed, be
greatly disappointed if he finds them backward in commending a
performance not entirely suited to their apprehensions. We cannot,
however, without some regret behold those talents so capable of giving
pleasure to all, exerted in efforts that, at best, can amuse only the
few; we cannot behold this rising Poet seeking fame among the learned,
without hinting to him the same advice that Isocrates used to give his
Scholars, <i>Study the People</i>. This study it is that has conducted the
great Masters of antiquity up to immortality. Pindar himself, of whom
our modern Lyrist is an imitator, appears entirely guided by it. He
adapted his works exactly to the dispositions of his countrymen.
Irregular[,] enthusiastic, and quick in transition,&mdash;he wrote for a
people inconstant, of warm imaginations and exquisite sensibility. He
chose the most popular subjects, and all his allusions are to customs
well known, in his day, to the meanest person.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>His English Imitator wants those advantages. He speaks to a people not
easily impressed with new ideas; extremely tenacious of the old; with
difficulty warmed; and as slowly cooling again.&mdash;How unsuited then to
our national character is that species of poetry which rises upon us
with unexpected flights! Where we must hastily catch the thought, or it
flies from us; and, in short, where the Reader must largely partake of
the Poet's enthusiasm, in order to taste his beauties. To carry the
parallel a little farther; the Greek Poet wrote in a language the most
proper that can be imagined for this species of composition; lofty,
harmonious, and never needing rhyme to heighten the numbers. But, for
us, several unsuccessful experiments seem to prove that the English
cannot have Odes in blank Verse; while, on the other hand, a natural
imperfection attends those which are composed in irregular rhymes:&mdash;the
similar sound often recurring where it is not expected, and not being
found where it is, creates no small confusion to the Reader,&mdash;who, as we
have not seldom observed, beginning in all the solemnity of poetic
elocution, is by frequent disappointments of the rhyme, at last obliged
to drawl out the uncomplying numbers into disagreeable prose.</p>

<p>It is, by no means, our design to detract from the merit of our Author's
present attempt: we would only intimate, that an English Poet,&mdash;one whom
the Muse has <i>mark'd for her own</i>, could produce a more luxuriant bloom
of flowers, by cultivating such as are natives of the soil, than by
endeavouring to force the exotics of another climate: or, to speak
without a metaphor, such a genius as Mr. Gray might give greater
pleasure, and acquire a larger portion of fame, if, instead of being an
imitator, he did justice to his talents, and ventured to be more an
original. These two Odes, it must be confessed, breath[e]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> much of the
spirit of Pindar, but then they have caught the seeming obscurity, the
sudden transition, and hazardous epithet, of his mighty master; all
which, though evidently intended for beauties, will, probably, be
regarded as blemishes, by the generality of his Readers. In short, they
are in some measure, a representation of what Pindar now appears to be,
though perhaps, not what he appeared to the States of Greece, when they
rivalled each other in his applause, and when Pan himself was seen
dancing to his melody.</p>

<p>In conformity to the antients, these Odes consist of the <i>Strophe</i>,
<i>Antistrophe</i>, and <i>Epode</i>, which, in each Ode, are thrice repeated. The
Strophes have a correspondent resemblance in their str[u]cture and
numbers: and the Antistrophe and Epode also bear the same similitude.
The Poet seems, in the first Ode particularly, to design the Epode as a
complete air to the Strophe and Antistrophe, which have more the
appearance of Recitative. There was a necessity for these divisions
among the antients, for they served as directions to the dancer and
musician; but we see no reason why they should be continued among the
moderns; for, instead of assisting, they will but perplex the Musician,
as our music requires a more frequent transition from the Air to the
Recitative than could agree with the simplicity of the antients.</p>

<p>The first of these Poems celebrates the Lyric Muse. It seems the most
laboured performance of the two, but yet we think its merit is not equal
to that of the second. It seems to want that regularity of plan upon
which the second is founded; and though it abounds with images that
strike, yet, unlike the second, it contains none that are affecting.</p>

<p>In the second Antistrophe the Bard thus marks the progress of Poetry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The second 'Ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales, that Edward
the first, when he compleated the conquest of that country, ordered all
the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death.' The Author seems
to have taken the hint of this subject from the fifteenth Ode of the
first book of Horace. Our Poet introduces the only surviving Bard of
that country in concert with the spirits of his murdered brethren, as
prophetically denouncing woes upon the Conqueror and his posterity. The
circumstances of grief and horror in which the Bard is represented,
those of terror in the preparation of the votive web, and the mystic
obscurity with which the prophecies are delivered, will give as much
pleasure to those who relish this species of composition, as anything
that has hitherto appeared in our language, the Odes of Dryden himself
not excepted.</p>

<p>The author has, in an elegant dedication to his brother, a country
clergyman, given the design of his poem:&mdash;'Without espousing the cause
of any party, I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I have
endeavoured to shew, that there may be equal happiness in other states,
though differently governed from our own; that each state has a peculiar
principle of happiness; and that this principle in each state,
particularly in our own, may be carried to a mischievous excess.'</p>

<p>That he may illustrate and enforce this important position, the author
places himself on a summit of the Alps, and, turning his eyes around, in
all directions, upon the different regions that lie before him,
compares, not merely their situation or policy, but those social and
domestic manners which, after a very few deductions, make the sum total
of human life.</p>

<p>The goods of life are either given by nature, or procured by ourselves.
Nature has distributed her gifts in very different proportions, yet all
her children are content; but the acquisitions of art are such as
terminate in good or evil, as they are differently regulated or
combined.</p>

<p>This is the position which he conducts through Italy, Swisserland,
France, Holland, and England; and which he endeavours to confirm by

<h2><span class="smcap">William Cowper</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Poems by William Cowper, of the Inner Temple, Esq.</i> <i>8vo. 5s.</i> Johnson.</p>

<p>These Poems are written, as we learn from the title-page, by Mr. Cowper
of the Inner Temple, who seems to be a man of a sober and religious turn
of mind, with a benevolent heart, and a serious wish to inculcate the
precepts of morality; he is not, however, possessed of any superior
abilities, or powers of genius, requisite to so arduous an undertaking;
his verses are, in general, weak and languid, and have neither novelty,
spirit, or animation, to recommend them; that mediocrity so severely
condemned by Horace,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non Dii non homines, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>pervades the whole; and, whilst the author avoids every thing that is
ridiculous or contemptible, he, at the same time, never rises to any
thing that we can commend or admire. He says what is incontrovertible,
and what has already been said over and over, with much gravity, but
says nothing new, sprightly, or entertaining; travelling on in a plain,
level, flat road, with great composure, almost through the whole long,
and rather tedious volume, which is little better than a dull sermon, in
very indifferent verse, on Truth, the Progress of Error, Charity, and
some other grave subjects. If this author had followed the advice given
by Caraccioli,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> has chosen for one of the mottos
prefixed to these Poems, he would have clothed his indisputable truths
in some becoming <i>disguise</i>, and rendered his work much more agreeable.
In its present state, we cannot compliment him on its shape or beauty;
for, as this bard himself <i>sweetly</i> sings,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The clear harangue, and cold as it is clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls soporific on the listless ear.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his learned dissertation on <i>Hope</i>, we meet with the following lines</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Quotes some fifty lines from <i>Hope</i> beginning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Build by whatever plan caprice decrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With what materials, on what ground you please, etc.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All this is very true; but there needs no ghost, nor author, nor poet,
to tell us what we knew before, unless he could tell it to us in a new
and better manner. Add to this, that many of our author's expressions
are coarse, vulgar, and unpoetical; such as <i>parrying</i>, <i>pushing by</i>,
<i>spitting abhorrence</i>, &amp;c. The greatest part of Mr. Cowper's didactics
is in the same strain. He attempts indeed sometimes to be lively,
facetious, and satirical; but is seldom more successful in this, than in
the serious and pathetic. In his poem on Conversation there are two or
three faint attempts at humour; in one of them he tells us that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A story in which native humour reigns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is often useful, always entertains,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But sedentary weavers of long tales,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At ev'ry interview their route the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The repetition makes attention lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We bustle up with unsuccessful speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the saddest part cry&mdash;droll indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The path of narrative with care pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still making probability your clue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all the vestiges of truth attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let them guide you to a decent end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all ambitions man may entertain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worst that can invade a sickly brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that which angles hourly for surprize,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who to please others will themselves disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet please not, but affront you to your face.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the passage above quoted, our readers will perceive that the wit is
rather aukward, [<i>sic</i>] and the verses, especially the last, very
prosaic.</p>

<p>Toward the end of this volume are some little pieces of a lighter kind,
which, after dragging through Mr. Cowper's long moral lectures, afforded
us some relief. The fables of the Lily and the Rose, the Nightingale and
Glow-worm, the Pine-apple and the Bee, with two or three others, are
written with ease and spirit. It is a pity that our author had not
confined himself altogether to this species of poetry, without entering
into a system of ethics, for which his genius seems but ill
adapted.&mdash;<i>The Critical Review</i>.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><i>Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</i>. <i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Robert Burns</span>,
<i>Kilmarnock</i>.</p>

<p>When an author we know nothing of solicits our attention, we are but too
apt to treat him with the same reluctant civility we show to a person
who has come unbidden into company. Yet talents and address will
gradually diminish the distance of our behaviour, and when the first
unfavourable impression has worn off, the author may become a favourite,
and the stranger a friend. The poems we have just announced may probably
have to struggle with the pride of learning and the partiality of
refinement; yet they are intitled to particular indulgence.</p>

<p>Who are you, Mr. Burns? will some surly critic say. At what university
have you been educated? what languages do you understand? what authors
have you particularly studied? whether has Aristotle or Horace directed
your taste? who has praised your poems, and under whose patronage are
they published? In short, what qualifications intitle you to instruct or
entertain us? To the questions of such a catechism, perhaps honest
Robert Burns would make no satisfactory answers. 'My good Sir, he might
say, I am a poor country man; I was bred up at the school of Kilmarnock;
I understand no languages but my own; I have studied Allan Ramsay and
Ferguson. My poems have been praised at many a fireside; and I ask no
patronage for them, if they deserve none. I have not looked on mankind
<i>through the spectacle of books</i>. An ounce of mother-wit, you know, is
worth a pound of clergy; and Homer and Ossian, for any thing that I have
heard, could neither write nor read.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> The author is indeed a striking
example of native genius bursting through the obscurity of poverty and
the obstructions of laborious life. He is said to be a common ploughman;
and when we consider him in this light, we cannot help regretting that
wayward fate had not placed him in a more favoured situation. Those who
view him with the severity of lettered criticism, and judge him by the
fastidious rules of art, will discover that he has not the doric
simplicity of Ramsay, nor the brilliant imagination of Ferguson; but to
those who admire the exertions of untutored fancy, and are blind to many
faults for the sake of numberless beauties, his poems will afford
singular gratification. His observations on human characters are acute
and sagacious, and his descriptions are lively and just. Of rustic
pleasantry he has a rich fund; and some of his softer scenes are touched
with inimitable delicacy. He seems to be a boon companion, and often
startles us with a dash of libertinism, which will keep some readers at
a distance. Some of his subjects are serious, but those of the humorous
kind are the best. It is not meant, however, to enter into a minute
investigation of his merits, as the copious extracts we have subjoined
will enable our readers to judge for themselves. The Character Horace
gives to Osellus is particularly applicable to him.</p>

Kilmarnock.</p>

<p>We have had occasion to examine a number of poetical productions,
written by persons in the lower rank of life, and who had hardly
received any education; but we do not recollect to have ever met with a
more signal instance of true and uncultivated genius, than in the author
of these Poems. His occupation is that of a common ploughman; and his
life has hitherto been spent in struggling with poverty. But all the
rigours of fortune have not been able to repress the frequent efforts of
his lively and vigorous imagination. Some of these poems are of a
serious cast; but the strain which seems most natural to the author, is
the sportive and humorous. It is to be regretted, that the Scottish
dialect, in which these poems are written, must obscure the native
beauties with which they appear to abound, and renders the sense often
unintelligible to an English reader. Should it, however, prove true,
that the author has been taken under the patronage of a great lady in
Scotland, and that a celebrated professor has interested himself in the
cultivation of his talents, there is reason to hope, that his
distinguished genius may yet be exerted in such a manner as to afford
more general delight. In the meantime, we must admire the generous
enthusiasm of his untutored muse; and bestow the tribute of just
applause on one whose name will be transmitted to posterity with
honour.&mdash;<i>The Critical Review</i>.</p>

<p>More descriptive poetry! (See page 166, &amp;c.) Have we not yet enough?
Must eternal changes be rung on uplands and lowlands, and nodding
forests, and brooding clouds, and cells, and dells, and dingles? Yes;
more, and yet more: so it is decreed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wordsworth begins his descriptive sketches with the following
exordium:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Were there, below, a spot of holy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Pain and her sad family <i>un</i>found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure, Nature's God that spot to man had giv'n,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where murmuring <i>rivers join</i> the song of <i>ev'n</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where <i>falls</i> the purple morning far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In flakes</i> of light upon the mountain side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where summer suns in ocean sink to rest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where rocks and groves the <i>power</i> of waters <i>shakes</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cataracts, or sleeps in quiet lakes.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>May we ask, how it is that rivers join the song of ev'n? or, in plain
prose, the evening! but, if they do, is it not true that they equally
join the song of morning, noon, and night? The <i>purple morning falling
in flakes</i> of light is a bold figure: but we are told, it falls far and
wide&mdash;Where?&mdash;On the mountain's <i>side</i>. We are sorry to see the purple
morning confined so like a maniac in a straight waistcoat. What the
night of wing of silence is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> we are unable to comprehend: but the
climax of the passage is, that, were there such a spot of holy ground as
is here so sublimely described, <i>unfound</i> by Pain and her sad family,
Nature's God had surely given that spot to man, though its <i>woods</i> were
<i>undiscovered</i>.</p>

the Lakes of the North of England. By W. Wordsworth, B.A. of St. John's,
Cambridge. 4to. pp. 27. 2s. Johnson. 1793.</p>

<p>In this Epistle, the subject and the manner of treating it vary but
little from the former poem. We will quote four lines from a passage
which the author very sorrowfully apologizes for having omitted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Return delights! with whom my road beg<i>un</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>Life-rear'd</i> laughing <i>up her</i> morning <i>sun</i>;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Life <i>rearing</i> up the sun! Transport kissing away an <i>April</i> tear and
<i>rocking</i> the year as in a dream! Would the cradle had been specified!
Seriously, these are figures which no poetical license can justify. If
they can possibly give pleasure, it must be to readers whose habits of
thinking are totally different from ours. Mr. Wordsworth is a scholar,
and, no doubt, when reading the works of others, a critic. There are
passages in his poems which display imagination, and which afford hope
for the future: but, if he can divest himself of all partiality, and
will critically question every line that he has written, he will find
many which, he must allow, call loudly for amendment.&mdash;<i>The Monthly
Review</i>.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><i>Lyrical Ballads, with a few other Poems</i>. <i>Small 8vo. 5s. Boards.</i>
Arch. 1798.</p>

<p>The majority of these poems, we are informed in the advertisement, are
to be considered as experiments.</p>

<p>'They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language
of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to
the purposes of poetic pleasure.' P. i.</p>

<p>Of these experimental poems, the most important is the Idiot Boy, the
story of which is simply this. Betty Foy's neighbour Susan Gale is
indisposed; and no one can conveniently be sent for the doctor but
Betty's idiot boy. She therefore puts him upon her poney, at eight
o'clock in the evening, gives him proper directions, and returns to take
care of her sick neighbour. Johnny is expected with the doctor by
eleven; but the clock strikes eleven, and twelve, and one, without the
appearance either of Johnny or the doctor. Betty's restless fears become
insupportable; and she now leaves her friend to look for her idiot son.
She goes to the doctor's house, but hears nothing of Johnny. About five
o'clock, however, she finds him sitting quietly upon his feeding poney.
As they go home they meet old Susan, whose apprehensions have cured her,
and brought her out to seek them; and they all return merrily together.</p>

<p>Upon this subject the author has written nearly five hundred lines. With
what spirit the story is told, our extract will evince.</p>

<p>[Quotes lines (322-401) of <i>The Idiot Boy</i>.]</p>

<p>No tale less deserved the labour that appears to have been bestowed upon
this. It resembles a Flemish picture in the worthlessness of its design
and the excellence of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> execution. From Flemish artists we are
satisfied with such pieces: who would not have lamented, if Corregio or
Rafaelle had wasted their talents in painting Dutch boors or the humours
of a Flemish wake?</p>

<p>The other ballads of this kind are as bald in story, and are not so
highly embellished in narration. With that which is entitled the Thorn,
we were altogether displeased. The advertisement says, it is not told in
the person of the author, but in that of some loquacious narrator. The
author should have recollected that he who personates tiresome
loquacity, becomes tiresome himself. The story of a man who suffers the
perpetual pain of cold, because an old woman prayed that he might never
be warm, is perhaps a good story for a ballad, because it is a
well-known tale: but is the author certain that it is '<i>well
authenticated?</i>' and does not such an assertion promote the popular
superstition of witchcraft?</p>

<p>In a very different style of poetry, is the Rime of the Ancyent
Marinere; a ballad (says the advertisement) 'professedly written in
imitation of the <i>style</i>, as well as of the spirit of the elder poets.'
We are tolerably conversant with the early English poets; and can
discover no resemblance whatever, except in antiquated spelling and a
few obsolete words. This piece appears to us perfectly original in style
as well as in story. Many of the stanzas are laboriously beautiful; but
in connection they are absurd or unintelligible. Our readers may
exercise their ingenuity in attempting to unriddle what follows.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We do not sufficiently understand the story to analyse it. It is a Dutch
attempt at German sublimity. Genius has here been employed in producing
a poem of little merit.</p>

<p>With pleasure we turn to the serious pieces, the better part of the
volume. The Foster-Mother's Tale is in the best style of dramatic
narrative. The Dungeon, and the Lines upon the Yew-tree Seat, are
beautiful. The Tale of the Female Vagrant is written in the stanza, not
the style, of Spenser. We extract a part of this poem.</p>

<p>[Quotes lines (91-180) of <i>The Female Vagrant</i>.]</p>

<p>Admirable as this poem is, the author seems to discover still superior
powers in the Lines written near Tintern Abbey. On reading this
production, it is impossible not to lament that he should ever have
condescended to write such pieces as the Last of the Flock, the Convict,
and most of the ballads. In the whole range of English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> poetry, we
scarcely recollect anything superior to a part of the following passage.</p>

<p>[Quotes lines (66-112) of <i>Lines Written a few Miles above Tintern
Abbey</i>.]</p>

<p>The 'experiment,' we think, has failed, not because the language of
conversation is little adapted to 'the purposes of poetic pleasure' but
because it has been tried upon uninteresting subjects. Yet every piece
discovers genius; and, ill as the author has frequently employed his
talents, they certainly rank him with the best of living poets.&mdash;<i>The

<p class="bigcenter"><i>Poems, in Two Volumes</i>. <i>By</i> <span class="smcap">William Wordsworth</span>, <i>Author of the Lyrical
Ballads.</i> 8vo. pp. 320. London, 1807.</p>

<p>This author is known to belong to a certain brotherhood of poets, who
have haunted for some years about the Lakes of Cumberland; and is
generally looked upon, we believe, as the purest model of the
excellences and peculiarities of the school which they have been
labouring to establish. Of the general merits of that school, we have
had occasion to express our opinion pretty freely, in more places than
one, and even to make some allusion to the former publications of the
writer now before us. We are glad, however, to have found an opportunity
of attending somewhat more particularly to his pretensions.</p>

<p>The Lyrical Ballads were unquestionably popular; and, we have no
hesitation in saying, deservedly popular; for in spite of their
occasional vulgarity, affectation, and silliness, they were undoubtedly
characterised by a strong spirit of originality, of pathos, and natural
feeling; and recommended to all good minds by the clear impression which
they bore of the amiable dispositions and virtuous principles of the
author. By the help of these qualities, they were enabled, not only to
recommend themselves to the indulgence of many judicious readers, but
even to beget among a pretty numerous class of persons, a sort of
admiration of the very defects by which they were attended. It was upon
this account chiefly, that we thought it necessary to set ourselves
against this alarming innovation. Childishness, conceit, and
affectation, are not of themselves very popular or attractive; and
though mere novelty has sometimes been found sufficient to give them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> a
temporary currency, we should have had no fear of their prevailing to
any dangerous extent, if they had been graced with no more seductive
accompaniments. It was precisely because the perverseness and bad taste
of this new school was combined with a great deal of genius and of
laudable feeling, that we were afraid of their spreading and gaining
ground among us, and that we entered into the discussion with a degree
of zeal and animosity which some might think unreasonable toward
authors, to whom so much merit had been conceded. There were times and
moods indeed, in which we were led to suspect ourselves of unjustifiable
severity, and to doubt, whether a sense of public duty had not carried
us rather too far in reprobation of errors, that seemed to be atoned
for, by excellences of no vulgar description. At other times, the
magnitude of these errors&mdash;the disgusting absurdities into which they
led their feebler admirers, and the derision and contempt which they
drew from the more fastidious, even upon the merits with which they were
associated, made us wonder more than ever at the perversity by which
they were retained, and regret that we had not declared ourselves
against them with still more formidable and decided hostility.</p>

<p>In this temper of mind, we read the <i>annonce</i> of Mr Wordsworth's
publication with a good deal of interest and expectation, and opened his
volumes with greater anxiety, than he or his admirers will probably give
us credit for. We have been greatly disappointed certainly as to the
quality of the poetry; but we doubt whether the publication has afforded
so much satisfaction to any other of his readers:&mdash;it has freed us from
all doubt or hesitation as to the justice of our former censures, and
has brought the matter to a test, which we cannot help hoping may be
convincing to the author himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Wordsworth, we think, has now brought the question, as to the merit
of his new school of poetry, to a very fair and decisive issue. The
volumes before us are much more strongly marked by all its peculiarities
than any former publication of the fraternity. In our apprehension, they
are, on this very account, infinitely less interesting or meritorious;
but it belongs to the public, and not to us, to decide upon their merit,
and we will confess, that so strong is our conviction of their obvious
inferiority, and the grounds of it, that we are willing for once to
wa[i]ve our right of appealing to posterity, and to take the judgment of
the present generation of readers, and even of Mr Wordsworth's former
admirers, as conclusive on this occasion. If these volumes, which have
all the benefit of the author's former popularity, turn out to be nearly
as popular as the lyrical ballads&mdash;if they sell nearly to the same
extent&mdash;or are quoted and imitated among half as many individuals, we
shall admit that Mr Wordsworth has come much nearer the truth in his
judgment of what constitutes the charm of poetry, than we had previously
imagined&mdash;and shall institute a more serious and respectful inquiry into
his principles of composition than we have yet thought necessary. On the
other hand,&mdash;if this little work, selected from the compositions of five
maturer years, and written avowedly for the purpose of exalting a
system, which has already excited a good deal of attention, should be
generally rejected by those whose prepossessions were in its favour,
there is room to hope, not only that the system itself will meet with no
more encouragement, but even that the author will be persuaded to
abandon a plan of writing, which defrauds his industry and talents of
their natural reward.</p>

<p>Putting ourselves thus upon our country, we certainly look for a verdict
against this publication; and have little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> doubt indeed of the result,
upon a fair consideration of the evidence contained in these
volumes.&mdash;To accelerate that result, and to give a general view of the
evidence, to those into whose hands the record may not have already
fallen, we must now make a few observations and extracts.</p>

<p>We shall not resume any of the particular discussions by which we
formerly attempted to ascertain the value of the improvements which this
new school had effected in poetry;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> but shall lay the grounds of our
opposition, for this time, a little more broadly. The end of poetry, we
take it, is to please&mdash;and the name, we think, is strictly applicable to
every metrical composition from which we receive pleasure, without any
laborious exercise of the understanding. This pleasure, may, in general,
be analyzed into three parts&mdash;that which we receive from the excitement
of Passion or emotion&mdash;that which is derived from the play of
Imagination, or the easy exercise of Reason&mdash;and that which depends on
the character and qualities of the Diction. The two first are the vital
and primary springs of poetical delight, and can scarcely require
explanation to any one. The last has been alternately overrated and
undervalued by the professors of the poetical art, and is in such low
estimation with the author now before us and his associates, that it is
necessary to say a few words in explanation of it.</p>

<p>One great beauty of diction exists only for those who have some degree
of scholarship or critical skill. This is what depends on the exquisite
<i>propriety</i> of the words employed, and the delicacy with which they are
adapted to the meaning which is to be expressed. Many of the finest
passages in Virgil and Pope derive their principal charm from the fine
propriety of their diction. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> source of beauty, which extends
only to the more instructed class of readers, is that which consists in
the judicious or happy application of expressions which have been
sanctified by the use of famous writers, or which bear the stamp of a
simple or venerable antiquity. There are other beauties of diction,
however, which are perceptible by all&mdash;the beauties of sweet sound and
pleasant associations. The melody of words and verses is indifferent to
no reader of poetry; but the chief recommendation of poetical language
is certainly derived from those general associations, which give it a
character of dignity or elegance, sublimity or tenderness. Every one
knows that there are low and mean expressions, as well as lofty and
grave ones; and that some words bear the impression of coarseness and
vulgarity, as clearly as others do of refinement and affection. We do
not mean, of course, to say anything in defence of the hackneyed
common-places of ordinary versemen. Whatever might have been the
original character of these unlucky phrases, they are now associated
with nothing but ideas of schoolboy imbecility and vulgar affectation.
But what we do maintain is, that much of the most popular poetry in the
world owes its celebrity chiefly to the beauty of its diction; and that
no poetry can be long or generally acceptable, the language of which is
coarse, inelegant, or infantine.</p>

<p>From this great source of pleasure, we think the readers of Mr
Wordsworth are in a great measure cut off. His diction has no where any
pretensions to elegance or dignity; and he has scarcely ever
condescended to give the grace of correctness or melody to his
versification. If it were merely slovenly and neglected, however, all
this might be endured. Strong sense and powerful feeling will ennoble
any expressions; or, at least, no one who is capable of estimating those
higher merits, will be dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>posed to mark these little defects. But, in
good truth, no man, now-a-days, composes verses for publication with a
slovenly neglect of their language. It is a fine and laborious
manufacture, which can scarcely ever be made in a hurry; and the faults
which it has, may, for the most part, be set down to bad taste or
incapacity, rather than to carelessness or oversight. With Mr Wordsworth
and his friends, it is plain that their peculiarities of diction are
things of choice, and not of accident. They write as they do, upon
principle and system; and it evidently costs them much pains to keep
<i>down</i> to the standard which they have proposed to themselves. They are,
to the full, as much mannerists, too, as the poetasters who ring changes
on the common-places of magazine versification; and all the difference
between them is, that they borrow their phrases from a different and a
scantier <i>gradus ad Parnassum</i>. If they were, indeed, to discard all
imitation and set phraseology, and to bring in no words merely for show
or for metre,&mdash;as much, perhaps, might be gained in freedom and
originality, as would infallibly be lost in allusion and authority; but,
in point of fact, the new poets are just as great borrowers as the old;
only that, instead of borrowing from the more popular passages of their
illustrious predecessors, they have preferred furnishing themselves from
vulgar ballads and plebeian nurseries.</p>

<p>Their peculiarities of diction alone, are enough, perhaps, to render
them ridiculous; but the author before us really seems anxious to court
this literary martyrdom by a device still more infallible,&mdash;we mean,
that of connecting his most lofty, tender, or impassioned conceptions,
with objects and incidents, which the greater part of his readers will
probably persist in thinking low, silly, or uninteresting. Whether this
is done from affectation and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> conceit alone, or whether it may not
arise, in some measure, from the self-illusion of a mind of
extraordinary sensibility, habituated to solitary meditation, we cannot
undertake to determine. It is possible enough, we allow, that the sight
of a friend's garden-spade, or a sparrow's nest, or a man gathering
leeches, might really have suggested to such a mind a train of powerful
impressions and interesting reflections; but it is certain, that, to
most minds, such associations will always appear forced, strained, and
unnatural; and that the composition in which it is attempted to exhibit
them, will always have the air of parody, or ludicrous and affected
singularity. All the world laughs at Elegiac stanzas to a sucking-pig&mdash;a
Hymn on Washing-day&mdash;Sonnets to one's grandmother&mdash;or Pindarics on
gooseberry-pye; and yet, we are afraid, it will not be quite easy to
convince Mr Wordsworth, that the same ridicule must infallibly attach to
most of the pathetic pieces in these volumes. To satisfy our readers,
however, as to the justice of this and our other anticipations, we shall
proceed, without further preface, to lay before them a short view of
their contents.</p>

<p>The first is a kind of ode 'to the Daisy,'&mdash;very flat, feeble, and
affected; and in a diction as artificial, and as much encumbered with
heavy expletives, as the theme of an unpractised schoolboy. The two
following stanzas will serve as a specimen.</p>

<p>The scope of the piece is to say, that the flower is found everywhere;
and that it has suggested many pleasant thoughts to the author&mdash;some
chime of fancy '<i>wrong or right</i>'&mdash;some feeling of devotion 'more or
less'&mdash;and other elegancies of the same stamp. It ends with this
unmeaning prophecy.</p>

<p>The next is called 'Louisa,' and begins in this dashing and affected
manner.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I met Louisa in the shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, having seen that lovely maid,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Does Mr Wordsworth really imagine that this is at all more natural or
engaging than the ditties of our common song writers?</p>

<p>A little farther on we have another original piece, entitled, 'The
Redbreast and the Butterfly,' of which our readers will probably be
contented with the first stanza.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Art thou the bird whom man loves best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious bird with the scarlet breast,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Our little English Robin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird that comes about our doors<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Art thou the Peter of Norway Boors?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their Thomas in Finland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Russia far inland?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird, whom <i>by some name or other</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men who know thee call their brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darling of children and men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could Father Adam open his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see this sight beneath the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd wish to close them again.' I. 16.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, it must be confessed, is 'Silly Sooth' in good earnest. The three
last [<i>sic</i>] lines seem to be downright raving.</p>

<p>By and by, we have a piece of namby-pamby 'to the Small Celandine,'
which we should almost have taken for a professed imitation of one of Mr
Philip's prettyisms. Here is a page of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Comfort have thou of thy merit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindly, unassuming spirit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of thy neighbourhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost show thy pleasant face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the moor, and in the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the lane;&mdash;there's not a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howsoever mean it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis good enough for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill befal the yellow flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children of the flaring hours!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buttercups, that will be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether we will see or no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others, too, of lofty mien;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have done as worldlings do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken praise that should be thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little, humble, Celandine!' I. 25.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After talking of its 'bright coronet,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> the ditty is wound up with this
piece of babyish absurdity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thou art not beyond the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a thing "beneath our shoon;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let, as old Magellan did,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Praise it is enough for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be but three or four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who will love my little flower.' I. 30.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this come some more manly lines on 'The Character of the Happy
Warrior,' and a chivalrous legend on 'The Horn of Egremont Castle,'
which, without being very good, is very tolerable, and free from most of
the author's habitual defects. Then follow some pretty, but professedly
childish verses, on a kitten playing with the falling leaves. There is
rather too much of Mr Ambrose Philips here and there in this piece also;
but it is amiable and lively.</p>

<p>Further on, we find an 'Ode to Duty,' in which the lofty vein is very
unsuccessfully attempted. This is the concluding stanza.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stern lawgiver! yet thou dost wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Godhead's most benignant grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor know we anything so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is the smile upon thy face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowers laugh before thee on their beds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fragrance in thy footing treads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong.' I. 73.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two last [<i>sic</i>] lines seem to be utterly without meaning; at least
we have no sort of conception in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> sense <i>Duty</i> can be said to keep
the old skies <i>fresh</i>, and the stars from wrong.</p>

<p>The next piece, entitled 'The Beggars,' may be taken, we fancy, as a
touchstone of Mr Wordsworth's merit. There is something about it that
convinces us it is a favourite of the author's; though to us, we will
confess, it appears to be a very paragon of silliness and affectation.
Our readers shall have the greater part of it. It begins thus.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'She had a tall man's height, or more;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No bonnet screen'd her from the heat;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A long drab-coloured cloak she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mantle reaching to her feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What other dress she had I could not know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only she wore a cap that was as white as snow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Before me begging did she stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pouring out sorrows like a sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grief after grief:&mdash;on English land<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such woes I knew could never be;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet a boon I gave her; for the creature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was beautiful to see; a weed of glorious feature!' I. 77, 78.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet, leaving this interesting person, falls in with two ragged boys
at play, and 'like that woman's face as gold is like to gold.' Here is
the conclusion of this memorable adventure.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'They bolted on me thus, and lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each ready with a plaintive whine;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said I, "Not half an hour ago<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your mother has had alms of mine."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"That cannot be," one answered, "She is dead."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay but I gave her pence, and she will buy you bread."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"She has been dead, Sir, many a day."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Sweet boys, you're telling me a lie";<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"It was your mother, as I say&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And in the twinkling of an eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Come, come!" cried one; and, without more ado,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off to some other play they both together flew.' I. 79.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Alice Fell' is a performance of the same order. The poet, driving into
Durham in a postchaise, hears a sort of scream; and, calling to the
post-boy to stop, finds a little girl crying on the back of the vehicle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My cloak!" the word was last and first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud and bitterly she wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if her very heart would burst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down from off the chaise she leapt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What ails you, child?" she sobb'd, "Look here!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw it in the wheel entangled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weather beaten rag as e'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From any garden scarecrow dangled.' I. 85, 86.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They then extricate the torn garment, and the good-natured bard takes
the child into the carriage along with him. The narrative proceeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My child, in Durham do you dwell?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She check'd herself in her distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "My name is Alice Fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm fatherless and motherless.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I to Durham, Sir, belong."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, as if the thought would choke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her very heart, her grief grew strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was for her tatter'd cloak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The chaise drove on; our journey's end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was nigh; and, sitting by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she'd lost her only friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept, nor would be pacified.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up to the tavern-door we post;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Alice and her grief I told;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I gave money to the host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy a new cloak for the old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"And let it be of duffil grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As warm a cloak as man can sell!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud creature was she the next day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little orphan, Alice Fell!' I. p. 87, 88.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the printing of such trash as this be not felt as an insult on the
public taste, we are afraid it cannot be insulted.</p>

<p>After this follows the longest and most elaborate poem in the volume,
under the title of 'Resolution and Independence.' The poet, roving about
on a common one fine morning, falls into pensive musings on the fate of
the sons of song, which he sums up in this fine distich.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'We poets in our youth begin in gladness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness.' I. p. 92.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the midst of his meditations&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I saw a man before me unawares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Motionless as a cloud the old man stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heareth not the loud winds when they call;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moveth altogether, if it move at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, himself unsettling, he the pond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the muddy water, which he conn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he had been reading in a book:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now such fre[e]dom as I could I took;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, drawing to his side, to him did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This morning gives us promise of a glorious day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What kind of work is that which you pursue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a lonesome place for one like you."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answer'd me <i>with pleasure and surprise</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was, while he spake, a fire about his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He told me <i>that he to this pond had come</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To gather leeches</i>, being old and poor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Employment hazardous and wearisome!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he had many hardships to endure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From pond to pond he roam'd, from moor to moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this way he gain'd an honest maintenance.' I. p. 92-95.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the distinctness of this answer, the poet, it seems, was
so wrapped up in his own moody fancies, that he could not attend to it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And now, not knowing what the old man had said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My question eagerly did I renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How is it that you live, and what is it you do?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with a smile did then his words repeat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, that, <i>gathering leeches</i>, far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He travelled; stirring thus <i>about his feet</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters of the ponds where they abide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Once I could meet with them on every side</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they have dwindled long by slow decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may." I. p. 96, 97.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This very interesting account, which he is lucky enough at last to
comprehend, fills the poet with comfort and admiration; and, quite glad
to find the old man so cheerful, he resolves to take a lesson of
contentedness from him; and the poem ends with this pious ejaculation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God," said I, "be my help and stay secure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor." I. p. 97.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We defy the bitterest enemy of Mr Wordsworth to produce anything at all
parallel to this from any collection of English poetry, or even from the
specimens of his friend Mr Southey. The volume ends with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> sonnets,
in a very different measure, of which we shall say something by and by.</p>

<p>The first poems in the second volume were written during a tour in
Scotland. The first is a very dull one about Rob Roy; but the title that
attracted us most was 'an Address to the Sons of <i>Burns</i>, after visiting
their Father's Grave.' Never was anything, however, more miserable. This
is one of the four stanzas.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Strong bodied if ye be to bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intemperance with less harm, beware!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if your father's wit ye share,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, then indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye sons of Burns! for watchful care<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There will be need.' II. p. 29.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next is a very tedious, affected performance, called 'the Yarrow
Unvisited.' The drift of it is, that the poet refused to visit this
celebrated stream, because he had 'a vision of his own' about it, which
the reality might perhaps undo; and, for this no less fantastical
reason&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Should life be dull, and spirits low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That earth has something yet to show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bonny holms of Yarrow!" II. p. 35.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this we come to some ineffable compositions which the poet has
simply entitled, 'Moods of my own Mind.' One begins&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O Nightingale! thou surely art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A creature of a fiery heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sing'st as if the god of wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had help'd thee to a valentine.' II. p. 42.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the whole of another&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My heart leaps up when I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A rainbow in the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So was it when my life began;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So is it now I am a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So be it when I shall grow old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or let me die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child is father of the man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I could wish my days to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound each to each by natural piety.' II. p. 44.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A third, 'on a Sparrow's Nest,' runs thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Look, five blue eggs are gleaming there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Few visions have I seen more fair,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor many prospects of delight</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More pleasing than that simple sight.' II. p. 53.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The charm of this fine prospect, however, was, that it reminded him of
another nest which his sister Emmeline and he had visited in their
childhood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'She look'd at it as if she fear'd it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still wishing, dreading to be near it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such heart was in her, being then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little prattler among men,' &amp;c., &amp;c. II. p. 54.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have then a rapturous mystical ode to the Cuckoo; in which the
author, striving after force and originality, produces nothing but
absurdity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O cuckoo! shall I call thee bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or but a wandering voice?' II. p. 57.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And then he says, that the said voice seemed to pass from hill to hill,
'about and all about!'&mdash;Afterwards he assures us, it tells him 'in the
vale of visionary hours,' and calls it a darling; but still insists,
that it is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No bird; but an invisible thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice,&mdash;a mystery.' II. p. 58.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>It is afterwards 'a hope;' and 'a love;' and, finally,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O blessed <i>bird</i>! the earth we pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again appears to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unsubstantial, faery place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is fit home for thee!' II. p. 59.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this there is an address to a butterfly, whom he invites to visit
him, in these simple strains&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'This plot of orchard-ground is ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My trees they are, my sister's flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop here whenever you are weary.' II. p. 61.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We come next to a long story of a 'Blind Highland Boy,' who lived near
an arm of the sea, and had taken a most unnatural desire to venture on
that perilous element. His mother did all she could to prevent him; but
one morning, when the good woman was out of the way, he got into a
vessel of his own, and pushed out from the shore.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In such a vessel ne'er before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did human creature leave the shore.' II. p. 72.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And then we are told, that if the sea should get rough, 'a bee-hive
would be ship as safe.' 'But say, what is it?' a poetical interlocutor
is made to exclaim most naturally; and here followeth the answer, upon
which all the pathos and interest of the story depend.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A <span class="smcap">Household Tub</span>, like one of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which women use to wash their clothes!!' II. p. 72.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, it will be admitted, is carrying the matter as far as it will well
go; nor is there anything,&mdash;down to the wiping of shoes, or the
evisceration of chickens,&mdash;which may not be introduced in poetry, if
this is tolerated. A boat is sent out and brings the boy ashore, who
being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> tolerably frightened we suppose, promises to go to sea no more;
and so the story ends.</p>

<p>Then we have a poem, called 'the Green Linnet,' which opens with the
poet's telling us;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A whispering leaf is now my joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a bird will be the <i>toy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">That doth my fancy <i>tether</i>.' II. p. 79.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and closes thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'While thus before my eyes he gleams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brother of the leaves he seems;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in a moment forth <i>he teems</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">His little song in gushes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if it pleas'd him to disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mock the form which he did feign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he was dancing with the train<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of leaves among the bushes.' II. p. 81.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next is called 'Star Gazers.' A set of people peeping through a
telescope, all seem to come away disappointed with the sight; whereupon
thus sweetly moralizeth our poet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yet, showman, where can lie the cause? Shall thy implement have blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boaster, that when he is tried, fails, and is put to shame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is it good as others are, and be their eyes in fault?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eyes, or minds? or, finally, is this resplendent vault?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or, is it rather, that conceit rapacious is and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bounty never yields so much but it seems to do her wrong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is it, that when human souls a journey long have had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are returned into themselves, they cannot but be sad?' II. p. 88.<br /></span>

<p>There are then some really sweet and amiable verses on a French lady,
separated from her own children, fondling the baby of a neighbouring
cottager;&mdash;after which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> have this quintessence of unmeaningness,
entitled, 'Foresight.'</p>

<span class="i0">'Spade! with which Wilkinson hath till'd his lands,'<br /></span>

<p>&mdash;but too dull to be quoted any further.</p>

<p>After this there is a Minstrel's Song, on the Restoration of Lord
Clifford the Shepherd, which is in a very different strain of poetry;
and then the volume is wound up with an 'Ode,' with no other title but
the motto, <i>Paulo majora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> canamus</i>. This is, beyond all doubt, the most

</div></div>

<p>We have thus gone through this publication, with a view to enable our
readers to determine, whether the author of the verses which have now
been exhibited, is entitled to claim the honours of an improver or
restorer of our poetry, and to found a new school to supersede or
new-model all our maxims on this subject. If we were to stop here, we do
not think that Mr Wordsworth, or his admirers, would have any reason to
complain; for what we have now quoted is undeniably the most peculiar
and characteristic part of his publication, and must be defended and
applauded if the merit or originality of his system is to be seriously
maintained. In our own opinion, however, the demerit of that system
cannot be fairly appreciated, until it be shown, that the author of the
bad verses which we have already extracted, can write good verses when
he pleases; and that, in point of fact, he does always write good
verses, when, by any accident, he is led to abandon his system, and to
transgress the laws of that school which he would fain establish on the
ruin of all existing authority.</p>

<p>The length to which our extracts and observations have already extended,
necessarily restrains us within more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> narrow limits in this part of our
citations; but it will not require much labour to find a pretty decided
contrast to some of the passages we have already detailed. The song on
the restoration of Lord Clifford is put into the mouth of an ancient
minstrel of the family; and in composing it, the author was led,
therefore, almost irresistibly to adopt the manner and phraseology that
is understood to be connected with that sort of composition, and to
throw aside his own babyish incidents and fantastical sensibilities. How
he has succeeded, the reader will be able to judge from the few
following extracts.</p>

<p>[Quotes fifty-six lines of <i>Lord Clifford</i>.]</p>

<p>All English writers of sonnets have imitated Milton; and, in this way,
Mr Wordsworth, when he writes sonnets, escapes again from the trammels
of his own unfortunate system; and the consequence is, that his sonnets
are as much superior to the greater part of his other poems, as Milton's
sonnets are superior to his.</p>

<p>[Quotes the sonnets <i>On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic</i>,
<i>London</i>, and <i>I griev'd for Buonaparte</i>.]</p>

<p>When we look at these, and many still finer passages, in the writings of
this author, it is impossible not to feel a mixtures of indignation and
compassion, at that strange infatuation which has bound him up from the
fair exercise of his talents, and withheld from the public the many
excellent productions that would otherwise have taken the place of the
trash now before us. Even in the worst of these productions, there are,
no doubt, occasional little traits of delicate feeling and original
fancy; but these are quite lost and obscured in the mass of childishness
and insipidity with which they are incorporated; nor can any thing give
us a more melancholy view of the debasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> effects of this miserable
theory, than that it has given ordinary men a right to wonder at the
folly and presumption of a man gifted like Mr Wordsworth, and made him
appear, in his second avowed publication, like a bad imitator of the
worst of his former productions.</p>

<p>We venture to hope, that there is now an end of this folly; and that,
like other follies, it will be found to have cured itself by the
extravagances resulting from its unbridled indulgence. In this point of
view, the publication of the volumes before us may ultimately be of
service to the good cause of literature. Many a generous rebel, it is
said, has been reclaimed to his allegiance by the spectacle of lawless
outrage and excess presented in the conduct of the insurgents; and we
think there is every reason to hope, that the lamentable consequences
which have resulted from Mr Wordsworth's open violation of the
established laws of poetry, will operate as a wholesome warning to those
who might otherwise have been seduced by his example, and be the means
of restoring to that antient and venerable code its due honour and
authority.&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Christabel: Kubla Khan, a Vision. The Pains of Sleep</i>. By <span class="smcap">S.T. Coleridge, Esq</span>. London, Murray, 1816.</p>

<p>The advertisement by which this work was announced to the publick,
carried in its front a recommendation from Lord Byron,&mdash;who, it seems,
has somewhere praised Christabel, as 'a wild and singularly original and
beautiful poem.' Great as the noble bard's merits undoubtedly are in
poetry, some of his latest <i>publications</i> dispose us to distrust his
authority, where the question is what ought to meet the public eye; and
the works before us afford an additional proof, that his judgment on
such matters is not absolutely to be relied on. Moreover, we are a
little inclined to doubt the value of the praise which one poet lends
another. It seems now-a-days to be the practice of that once irritable
race to laud each other without bounds; and one can hardly avoid
suspecting, that what is thus lavishly advanced may be laid out with a
view to being repaid with interest. Mr Coleridge, however, must be
judged by his own merits.</p>

<p>It is remarked, by the writers upon the Bathos, that the true <i>profound</i>
is surely known by one quality&mdash;its being wholly bottomless; insomuch,
that when you think you have attained its utmost depth in the work of
some of its great masters, another, or peradventure the same, astonishes
you, immediately after, by a plunge so much more vigorous, as to outdo
all his former outdoings. So it seems to be with the new school, or, as
they may be termed, the wild or lawless poets. After we had been
admiring their extravagance for many years, and marvelling at the ease
and rapidity with which one exceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> another in the unmeaning or
infantine, until not an idea was left in the rhyme&mdash;or in the insane,
until we had reached something that seemed the untamed effusion of an
author whose thoughts were rather more free than his actions&mdash;forth
steps Mr Coleridge, like a giant refreshed with sleep, and as if to
redeem his character after so long a silence, ('his poetic powers having
been, he says, from 1808 till very lately, in a state of suspended
animation,' p. v.) and breaks out in these precise words&mdash;</p>

<p>It is probable that Lord Byron may have had this passage in his eye,
when he called the poem 'wild' and 'original;' but how he discovered it
to be 'beautiful,' is not quite so easy for us to imagine.</p>

<p>Much of the art of the wild writers consists in sudden
transitions&mdash;opening eagerly upon some topic, and then flying from it
immediately. This indeed is known to the medical men, who not
unfrequently have the care of them, as an unerring symptom. Accordingly,
here we take leave of the Mastiff Bitch, and lose sight of her entirely,
upon the entrance of another personage of a higher degree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The lovely Lady Christabel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom her father loves so well'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And who, it seems, has been rambling about all night, having, the night
before, had dreams about her lover, which 'made her moan and <i>leap</i>.'
While kneeling, in the course of her rambles, at an old oak, she hears a
noise on the other side of the stump, and going round, finds, to her
great surprize, another fair damsel in white silk, but with her dress
and hair in some disorder; at the mention of whom, the poet takes
fright, not, as might be imagined, because of her disorder, but on
account of her beauty and her fair attire&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I guess, 'twas frightful there to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady so richly clad as she&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful exceedingly!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Christabel naturally asks who she is, and is answered, at some length,
that her name is Geraldine; that she was, on the morning before, seized
by five warriors, who tied her on a white horse, and drove her on, they
themselves following, also on white horses; and that they had rode all
night. Her narrative now gets to be a little contradictory, which gives
rise to unpleasant suspicions. She protests vehemently, and with oaths,
that she has no idea who the men were; only that one of them, the
tallest of the five, took her and placed her under the tree, and that
they all went away, she knew not whither; but how long she had remained
there she cannot tell&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nor do I know how long it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have lain in fits, I <i>wis</i>;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;although she had previously kept a pretty exact account of the time.
The two ladies then go home together, after this satisfactory
explanation, which appears to have con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>veyed to the intelligent mind of
Lady C. every requisite information. They arrive at the castle, and pass
the night in the same bed-room; not to disturb Sir Leoline, who, it
seems, was poorly at the time, and, of course, must have been called up
to speak to the chambermaids, and have the sheets aired, if Lady G. had
had a room to herself. They do not get to their bed, however in the
poem, quite so easily as we have carried them. They first cross the
moat, and Lady C. 'took the key that fitted well,' and opened a little
door, 'all in the middle of the gate.' Lady G. then sinks down 'belike
through pain;' but it should seem more probably from laziness; for her
fair companion having lifted her up, and carried her a little way, she
then walks on 'as she were not in pain.' Then they cross the court&mdash;but
we must give this in the poet's words, for he seems so pleased with
them, that he inserts them twice over in the space of ten lines.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So free from danger, free from fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crossed the court&mdash;right glad they were.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lady C. is desirous of a little conversation on the way, but Lady G.
will not indulge her Ladyship, saying she is too much tired to speak. We
now meet our old friend, the mastiff bitch, who is much too important a
person to be slightly passed by&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Outside her kennel, the mastiff old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mastiff old did not awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she an angry moan did make!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what can ail the mastiff bitch?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never till now she uttered yell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the eye of Christabel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what can ail the mastiff bitch?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>Whatever it may be that ails the bitch, the ladies pass forward, and
take off their shoes, and tread softly all the way upstairs, as
Christabel observes that her father is a bad sleeper. At last, however,
they do arrive at the bed-room, and comfort themselves with a dram of
some homemade liquor, which proves to be very old; for it was made by
Lady C.'s mother; and when her new friend asks if she thinks the old
lady will take her part, she answers, that this is out of the question,
in as much as she happened to die in childbed of her. The mention of the
old lady, however, gives occasion to the following pathetic
couplet.&mdash;Christabel says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O mother dear, that thou wert here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would, said Geraldine, she were!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very mysterious conversation next takes place between Lady Geraldine
and the old gentlewoman's ghost, which proving extremely fatiguing to
her, she again has recourse to the bottle&mdash;and with excellent effect, as
appears by these lines.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Again the wild-flower wine she drank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And from the floor whereon she sank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty Lady stood upright:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was most beautiful to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a Lady of a far countr&eacute;e.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;From which, we may gather among other points, the exceeding great
beauty of all women who live in a distant place, no matter where. The
effects of the cordial speedily begin to appear; as no one, we imagine,
will doubt, that to its influence must be ascribed the following
speech<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And thus the lofty lady spake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All they, who live in the upper sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do love you, holy Christabel!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you love them&mdash;and for their sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the good which me befel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even I in my degree will try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair maiden, to requite you well.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before going to bed, Lady G. kneels to pray, and desires her friend to
undress, and lie down; which she does 'in her loveliness;' but being
curious, she leans 'on her elbow,' and looks toward the fair
devotee,&mdash;where she sees something which the poet does not think fit to
tell us very explicitly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Her silken robe, and inner vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropt to her feet, and full in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! her bosom and half her side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sight to dream of, not to tell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she is to sleep by Christabel.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She soon rises, however, from her knees; and as it was not a
double-bedded room, she turns in to Lady Christabel, taking only 'two
paces and a stride.' She then clasps her tight in her arms, and mutters
a very dark spell, which we apprehend the poet manufactured by shaking
words together at random; for it is impossible to fancy that he can
annex any meaning whatever to it. This is the end of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'But vainly thou warrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For this is alone in<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy power to declare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>The consequence of this incantation is, that Lady Christabel has a
strange dream&mdash;and when she awakes, her first exclamation is, 'Sure I
have sinn'd'&mdash;'Now heaven be praised if all be well!' Being still
perplexed with the remembrance of her 'too lively' dream&mdash;she then
dresses herself, and modestly prays to be forgiven for 'her sins
unknown.' The two companions now go to the Baron's parlour, and
Geraldine tells her story to him. This, however, the poet judiciously
leaves out, and only signifies that the Baron recognized in her the
daughter of his old friend Sir Roland, with whom he had had a deadly
quarrel. Now, however, he despatches his tame poet, or laureate, called
Bard Bracy, to invite him and his family over, promising to forgive
every thing, and even make an apology for what had passed. To understand
what follows, we own, surpasses our comprehension. Mr Bracy, the poet,
recounts a strange dream he has just had, of a dove being almost
strangled by a snake; whereupon the Lady Geraldine falls a hissing, and
her eyes grow small, like a serpent's,&mdash;or at least so they seem to her
friend; who begs her father to 'send away that woman.' Upon this the
Baron falls into a passion, as if he had discovered that his daughter
had been seduced; at least, we can understand him in no other sense,
though no hint of such a kind is given; but on the contrary, she is
painted to the last moment as full of innocence and
purity.&mdash;Nevertheless,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Nothing further is said to explain the mystery; but there follows
incontinently, what is termed '<i>The conclusion of Part the Second</i>.' And
as we are pretty confident that Mr Coleridge holds this passage in the
highest estimation; that he prizes it more than any other part of 'that
wild, and singularly original and beautiful poem Christabel,' excepting
always the two passages touching the 'toothless mastiff bitch;' we shall
extract it for the amazement of our readers&mdash;premising our own frank
avowal that we are wholly unable to divine the meaning of any portion of
it.</p>

<p>Hence endeth the Second Part, and, in truth, the 'singular' poem itself;
for the author has not yet written, or, as he phrases it, 'embodied in
verse,' the 'three parts yet to come;'&mdash;though he trusts he shall be
able to do so' in the course of the present year.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>One word as to the metre of Christabel, or, as Mr Coleridge terms it,
'<i>the</i> Christabel'&mdash;happily enough; for indeed we doubt if the peculiar
force of the definite article was ever more strongly exemplified. He
says, that though the reader may fancy there prevails a great
<i>irregularity</i> in the metre, some lines being of four, others of twelve
syllables, yet in reality it is quite regular; only that it is 'founded
on a new principle, namely, that of counting in each line the accents,
not the syllables.' We say nothing of the monstrous assurance of any man
coming forward coolly at this time of day, and telling the readers of
English poetry, whose ear has been tuned to the lays of Spenser, Milton,
Dryden, and Pope, that he makes his metre 'on a new principle!' but we
utterly deny the truth of the assertion, and defy him to show us <i>any</i>
principle upon which his lines can be conceived to tally. We give two or
three specimens to confound at once this miserable piece of coxcombry
and shuffling. Let our 'wild, and singularly original and beautiful'
author, show us how these lines agree either in number of accents or of
feet.</p>

<p><i>Kubla Khan</i> is given to the public, it seems, 'at the request of a poet
of great and deserved celebrity;'&mdash;but whether Lord Byron, the praiser
of 'the Christabel,' or the Laureate, the praiser of Princes, we are not
informed. As far as Mr Coleridge's 'own opinions are concerned,' it is
published, 'not upon the ground of any <i>poetic</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> merits,' but 'as a
<span class="smcap lowercase">PSYCHOLOGICAL CURIOSITY</span>!' In these opinions of the candid author, we
entirely concur; but for this reason we hardly think it was necessary to
give the minute detail which the Preface contains, of the circumstances
attending its composition. Had the question regarded '<i>Paradise Lost</i>,'
or '<i>Dryden's Ode</i>,' we could not have had a more particular account of
the circumstances in which it was composed. It was in the year 1797, and
in the summer season. Mr Coleridge was in bad health;&mdash;the particular
disease is not given; but the careful reader will form his own
conjectures. He had retired very prudently to a lonely farm-house; and
whoever would see the place which gave birth to the 'psychological
curiosity,' may find his way thither without a guide; for it is situated
on the confines of Somerset and Devonshire, and on the Exmoor part of
the boundary; and it is, moreover, between Porlock and Linton. In that
farm-house, he had a slight indisposition, and had taken an anodyne,
which threw him into a deep sleep in his chair (whether after dinner or
not he omits to state), 'at the moment that he was reading a sentence in
Purchas's Pilgrims,' relative to a palace of Kubla Khan. The effects of
the anodyne, and the sentence together, were prodigious: They produced
the 'curiosity' now before us; for, during his three-hours sleep, Mr
Coleridge 'has the most vivid confidence that he could not have composed
less than from two to three hundred lines.' On awaking, he 'instantly
and eagerly' wrote down the verses here published; when he was (he says,
'<i>unfortunately</i>') called out by a 'person on business from Porlock, and
detained by him above an hour;' and when he returned the vision was
gone. The lines here given smell strongly, it must be owned, of the
anodyne; and, but that an under dose of a sedative produces contrary
effects, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> should inevitably have been lulled by them into
forgetfulness of all things. Perhaps a dozen more such lines as the
following would reduce the most irritable of critics to a state of
inaction.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'A damsel with a dulcimer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And close your eyes with holy dread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he on honey-dew hath fed,' &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a good deal more altogether as exquisite&mdash;and in particular a
fine description of a wood, 'ancient as the hills;' and 'folding sunny
spots of <i>greenery</i>!' But we suppose this specimen will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Persons in this poet's unhappy condition, generally feel the want of
sleep as the worst of their evils; but there are instances, too, in the
history of the disease, of sleep being attended with new agony, as if
the waking thoughts, how wild and turbulent soever, had still been under
some slight restraint, which sleep instantly removed. Mr Coleridge
appears to have experienced this symptom, if we may judge from the title
of his third poem, '<i>The Pains of Sleep</i>;' and, in truth, from its
composition&mdash;which is mere raving, without any thing more affecting than
a num<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ber of incoherent words, expressive of extravagance and
incongruity.&mdash;We need give no specimen of it.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, we look upon this publication as one of the most notable
pieces of impertinence of which the press has lately been guilty; and
one of the boldest experiments that has yet been made on the patience or
understanding of the public. It is impossible, however, to dismiss it,
without a remark or two. The other productions of the Lake School have
generally exhibited talents thrown away upon subjects so mean, that no
power of genius could ennoble them; or perverted and rendered useless by
a false theory of poetical composition. But even in the worst of them,
if we except the White Doe of Mr Wordsworth and some of the laureate
odes, there were always some gleams of feeling or of fancy. But the
thing now before us is utterly destitute of value. It exhibits from
beginning to end not a ray of genius; and we defy any man to point out a
passage of poetical merit in any of the three pieces which it contains,
except, perhaps, the following lines in p. 32, and even these are not
very brilliant; nor is the leading thought original&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Alas! they had been friends in youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whispering tongues can poison truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And constancy lives in realms above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life is thorny; and youth is vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to be wroth with one we love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth work like madness in the brain.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With this one exception, there is literally not one couplet in the
publication before us which would be reckoned poetry, or even sense,
were it found in the corner of a newspaper or upon the window of an inn.
Must we then be doomed to hear such a mixture of raving and driv'ling,
extolled as the work of a '<i>wild and original</i>' genius, simply because
Mr Coleridge has now and then written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> fine verses, and a brother poet
chooses, in his milder mood, to laud him from courtesy or from interest?
And are such panegyrics to be echoed by the mean tools of a political
faction, because they relate to one whose daily prose is understood to
be dedicated to the support of all that courtiers think should be
supported? If it be true that the author has thus earned the patronage
of those liberal dispensers of bounty, we can have no objection that
they should give him proper proofs of their gratitude; but we cannot
help wishing, for his sake, as well as our own, that they would pay in
solid pudding instead of empty praise; and adhere, at least in this
instance, to the good old system of rewarding their champions with
places and pensions, instead of puffing their bad poetry, and
endeavouring to cram their nonsense down the throats of all the loyal
and well affected.&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Robert Southey</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Madoc</i>, by <span class="smcap">Robert Southey</span>. 4to. pp. 560. 2l. 2s. Boards. Printed at
Edinburgh, for Longman and Co., London. 1805.</p>

<p>It has fallen to the lot of this writer to puzzle our critical
discernment more than once. In the <i>Annual Anthology</i> we had reason to
complain that it was difficult to distinguish his jocular from his
serious poetry; and sometimes indeed to know his poetry from his prose.
He has now contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled
a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide. The
title of epic, which he indignantly disclaims, we might have been
inclined to refuse his production, had it been claimed; and we suppose
that Mr. Southey would not suffer it to be classed under the
mock-heroic. The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor
classical, in any respect. Neither is it <i>Macphersonic</i>, nor
<i>Klopstockian</i>, nor <i>Darwinian</i>,&mdash;we beg pardon, we mean <i>Brookian</i>. To
conclude, according to a phrase of the last century, which was applied
to ladies of ambiguous character, <i>it is what it is</i>.&mdash;As Mr. Southey
has set the rules of Aristotle at defiance in his preface, we hope that
he will feel a due degree of gratitude for this appropriate definition
of his work. It is an old saying, thoroughly descriptive of such an old
song as this before us.</p>

<p>Mr. Southey, however, has not disdained all ancient precedents in his
poem, for he introduces it with this advertisement:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come, listen to a tale of times of old!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, for ye know me! I am he who sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid of Arc; and I am he who framed<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of Thalaba the wild and wonderous song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, listen to my lay, and ye shall hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Madoc from the shores of Britain spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The adventurous sail, explored the ocean ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quelled barbarian power, and overthrew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bloody altars of idolatry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And planted in its fanes triumphantly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cross of Christ. Come, listen to my lay!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This <i>modest ostentation</i> was certainly derived from the verses imputed
to Virgil;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ille ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carmen; et egressus sylvis, vicina co&euml;gi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gratum opus agricolis: at nunc horrentia Martis, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the very first part of the poem, also, we find Mr. Southey pursuing
the Horatian precept, "<i>prorumpere in medias res</i>;" for he commences
with the <i>return</i> of Madoc to his native country. It is true that, like
the Messenger in Macklin's tragedy, he "goes but to return;" and the
critic is tempted to say, with Martial, <i>toto carere possum</i>.&mdash;Thus the
grand interest of the work, which ought to consist in exploring a new
world, is destroyed at once, by the reader at his outset encountering
the heroes returning "sound, wind and limb," to their native country. It
may be said that Cam&#339;ns has thrown a great part of Da Gama's Voyage
into the form of a narrative: but he has also given much in description;
enough, at least, to have justified Mr. Southey in commencing rather
nearer the commencement of his tale.</p>

<p>That he might withdraw himself entirely from the yoke of Aristotle, Mr.
Southey has divided his poem into two parts, instead of giving it a
beginning, a middle and an end. One of these parts is concisely
entitled, 'Madoc in Wales;' the other, 'Madoc in Aztlan.' A <i>middle</i>
might,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> however, have been easily found, by adding, <i>Madoc on
Shipboard</i>.&mdash;The first of these Anti Peripatetic parts contains 18
divisions; the second, 27 which include every incident, episode, &amp;c.
introduced into the poem. This arrangement gives it very much the
appearance of a journal versified, and effectually precludes any
imputation of luxuriance of fancy in the plot.</p>

<p>Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey appears to have been more successful
than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he
could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed
him, he has had recourse to probability. Yet we own that the
nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our
prejudices. <i>Goervyl</i> and <i>Ririd</i> and <i>Rodri</i> and <i>Llaian</i> may have
charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in <i>Tezozomoc</i>,
<i>Tlalala</i>, or <i>Ocelopan</i>? Or, should</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;'Tyneio, Merini,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boda and Brenda and Aelgyvarch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gwynon and Celynin and Gwynodyl,' (p. 129.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>how could we swallow <i>Yuhidthiton</i>, <i>Coanocotzin</i>, and, above all, the
yawning jaw-dislocating <i>Ayayaca</i>?&mdash;These torturing words, particularly
the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse
and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated. Mr. Southey's
defence (for he has partially anticipated this objection) is that the
names are conformable to history or analogy, which we are not inclined
to dispute: but it is not requisite to tread so closely in the traces of
barbarity. Truth does not constitute the essence of poetry: but it is
indispensably necessary that the lines should be agreeable to the ear,
as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> as to the sense. Sorry, indeed, we are to complain that Mr.
Southey, in attempting a new method of writing,&mdash;in professing to set
aside the old models, and to promote his own work to a distinguished
place in the library,&mdash;has failed to interest our feelings, or to excite
our admiration. The dull tenor of mediocrity, which characterizes his
pages, is totally unsuitable to heroic poetry, regular or irregular.
Instead of viewing him on a <i>fiery Pegasus</i>, and "snatching a grace
beyond the reach of art," we behold the author mounted on a strange
animal, something between a rough Welsh poney and a Peruvian sheep,
whose utmost capriole only tends to land him in the mud. We may indeed
safely compliment Mr. Southey, by assuring him that there is nothing in
Homer, Virgil, or Milton, in any degree resembling the beauties of
Madoc.</p>

<p>Whether the expedition of Madoc, and the existence of a Welsh tribe in
America, be historically true, it is not our present business to
examine. It is obvious, however, that one great object of the poem, the
destruction of the altars of idolatry, had failed; for it is not
pretended that the supposed descendants of Madoc remained Christians.</p>

<p>We shall now make some extracts from this poem, which will enable our
readers to judge whether we have spoken too severely of Mr. Southey's
labours.</p>

<p>[Quotes 270 lines of <i>Madoc</i> with interpolated comments.]</p>

<p>If the perusal of these and the preceding verses should tempt any of our
readers to purchase Mr. Southey's volume, we can warrant equal
entertainment in all its other parts, and shall heartily wish the
gentleman all happiness with his poet.&mdash;To us, there appears a thorough
perversion of taste, in the conception and execution of the whole; and
we are disgusted with the tameness of the verse, the vulgarity of the
thoughts, and the barbarity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> the manners. If this style of writing be
continued, we may expect not only the actions of Vindomarus or
Ariovistus to be celebrated, but we may perhaps see the history of the
Cherokees, Choctaws, and Catabaws, versified in quarto. The name of
Atakulla-kulla would not be inharmonious, compared with some of Mr.
Southey's heroes. Indeed, a very interesting poem might be founded on
the story of Pocahuntas, as it is detailed by Smith, in his History of
the Settlement of Virginia; and if Mr. Southey should meditate another
irruption into the territories of the Muse, we would recommend this
subject to his attention.</p>

<p>It must be remarked that this is a very handsome and elegantly printed
book, with engraved title-pages, vignettes, &amp;c. and had the poet
equalled the printer, his work might have stood on the same shelf with
those of our most admired writers.&mdash;<i>The Monthly Review</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, speaking of blank verse, seemed to have adopted the opinion
of some great man,&mdash;we forget whom,&mdash;that it is only "<i>poetry to the

we have sometimes rather inclined to the same idea, but the recollection
of Milton and Thomson presently banished it.</p>

<p>We have more than once delivered our sentiments respecting the poetry of
Mr. Charles Lloyd. To what we have formerly remarked, in general on this
head, we have little to add on the present occasion; except that we
begin to grow weary of his continued <b>melancholy</b> strains. Why is this
ingenious writer so uncomfortably constant to the <i>mournful</i> Muse? If he
has any taste for variety, he has little to fear from <i>jealousy</i> in the

<p>If any thing could prevent our laughing at the present collection of
absurdities, it would be a lamentable conviction of the blinding and
engrossing nature of vanity. We could forgive the folly of the original
composition, but cannot but marvel at the egotism which has preserved,
and the conceit which has published. What exaggerated notion must that
man entertain of his talents, who believes their slightest efforts
worthy of remembrance; one who keeps a copy of the verses he writes in
young ladies' albums, the proverbial receptacles for trash! Here and
there a sweet and natural thought intervenes; but the chief part is best
characterized by that expressive though ungracious word "rubbish." And
what could induce our author to trench on the masculine and vigorous
Crabbe? did he think his powerful and dark outlines might with advantage
be turned to "prettiness and favour?" But let our readers judge from the

<p>How this Poem, which appears to issue from the same publishers as our

us a matter of doubt. Turgid obscurity is the general character of the
composition, with now and then a gleam of genuine poetry, irradiating
the dark profound. The effect of the perusal is to give a kind of whirl

<p>An unpractised author has attempted, in this poem, the difficult task of
relating a romantic story in blank-verse. His performance betrays all
the incorrectness and abruptness of inexperience, but it manifests
occasionally some talent for description. He has fallen into the common

borrowing too many phrases and epithets from our incomparable Milton. We

<h2><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Marmion; a Tale of Flodden Field</i>. By <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>, Esq. 4to. pp. 500.
Edinburgh and London, 1808.</p>

<p>There is a kind of right of primogeniture among books, as well as among
men; and it is difficult for an author, who has obtained great fame by a
first publication, not to appear to fall off in a second&mdash;especially if
his original success could be imputed, in any degree, to the novelty of
his plan of composition. The public is always indulgent to untried
talents; and is even apt to exaggerate a little the value of what it
receives without any previous expectation. But, for this advance of
kindness, it usually exacts a most usurious return in the end. When the
poor author comes back, he is no longer received as a benefactor, but a
debtor. In return for the credit it formerly gave him, the world now
conceives that it has a just claim on him for excellence, and becomes
impertinently scrupulous as to the quality of the coin in which it is to
be paid.</p>

<p>The just amount of this claim plainly cannot be for more than the rate
of excellence which he had reached in his former production; but, in
estimating this rate, various errors are perpetually committed, which
increase the difficulties of the task which is thus imposed on him. In
the <i>first</i> place, the comparative amount of his past and present merits
can only be ascertained by the uncertain standard of his reader's
feelings; and these must always be less lively with regard to a second
performance; which, with every other excellence of the first, must
necessarily want the powerful recommendations of novelty and surprise,
and consequently fall very far short of the effect produced by their
strong co&ouml;peration. In the <i>second</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> place, it may be observed, in
general, that wherever our impression of any work is favourable on the
whole, its excellence is constantly exaggerated, in those vague and
habitual recollections which form the basis of subsequent comparisons.
We readily drop from our memory the dull and bad passages, and carry
along with us the remembrance of those only which had afforded us
delight. Thus, when we take the merit of any favourite poem as a
standard of comparison for some later production of the same author, we
never take its true average merit, which is the only fair standard, but
the merit of its most striking and memorable passages, which naturally
stand forward in our recollection, and pass upon our hasty retrospect as
just and characteristic specimens of the whole work; and this high and
exaggerated standard we rigorously apply to the first, and perhaps the
least interesting parts of the second performance. Finally, it deserves
to be noticed, that where a first work, containing considerable
blemishes, has been favourably received, the public always expects this
indulgence to be repaid by an improvement that ought not to be always
expected. If a second performance appear, therefore, with the same
faults, they will no longer meet with the same toleration. Murmurs will
be heard about indolence, presumption, and abuse of good nature; while
the critics, and those who had gently hinted at the necessity of
correction, will be more out of humour than the rest at this apparent
neglect of their admonitions.</p>

<p>For these, and for other reasons, we are inclined to suspect, that the
success of the work now before us will be less brilliant than that of
the author's former publication, though we are ourselves of opinion,
that its intrinsic merits are nearly, if not altogether, equal; and
that, if it had had the fortune to be the elder born, it would have
inherited as fair a portion of renown as has fallen to the lot of its
pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>decessor. It is a good deal longer, indeed, and somewhat more
ambitious; and it is rather clearer that it has greater faults, than
that it has greater beauties; though, for our own parts, we are inclined
to believe in both propositions. It has more tedious and flat passages,
and more ostentation of historical and antiquarian lore; but it has also
greater richness and variety, both of character and incident; and if it
has less sweetness and pathos in the softer passages, it has certainly
more vehemence and force of colouring in the loftier and busier
representations of action and emotion. The place of the prologuizing
minstrel is but ill supplied, indeed, by the epistolary dissertations
which are prefixed to each book of the present poem; and the ballad
pieces and mere episodes which it contains, have less finish and
poetical beauty; but there is more airiness and spirit in the lighter
delineations; and the story, if not more skilfully conducted, is at
least better complicated, and extended through a wider field of
adventure. The characteristics of both, however, are evidently the
same;&mdash;a broken narrative&mdash;a redundancy of minute description&mdash;bursts of
unequal and energetic poetry&mdash;and a general tone of spirit and
animation, unchecked by timidity or affectation, and unchastised by any
great delicacy of taste, or elegance of fancy.</p>

<p>But though we think this last romance of Mr Scott's about as good as the
former, and allow that it affords great indications of poetical talent,
we must remind our readers, that we never entertained much partiality
for this sort of composition, and ventured on a former occasion to
express our regret, that an author endowed with such talents should
consume them in imitations of obsolete extravagance, and in the
representation of manners and sentiments in which none of his readers
can be supposed to take much interest, except the few who can judge of
their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> exactness. To write a modern romance of chivalry, seems to be
much such a fantasy as to build a modern abbey, or an English pagoda.
For once, however, it may be excused as a pretty caprice of genius; but
a second production of the same sort is entitled to less indulgence, and
imposes a sort of duty to drive the author from so idle a task, by a
fair exposition of the faults which are in a manner inseparable from its
execution. To enable our readers to judge fairly of the present
performance, we shall first present them with a brief abstract of the
story; and then endeavour to point out what seems to be exceptionable,
and what is praiseworthy, in the execution.</p>

<p>[Here follows a detailed outline of the plot of <i>Marmion</i>.]</p>

<p>Now, upon this narrative, we are led to observe, in the first place,
that it forms a very scanty and narrow foundation for a poem of such
length as is now before us. There is scarcely matter enough in the main
story for a ballad of ordinary dimensions; and the present work is not
so properly diversified with episodes and descriptions, as made up and
composed of them. No long poem, however, can maintain its interest
without a connected narrative. It should be a grand historical picture,
in which all the personages are concerned in one great transaction, and
not a mere gallery of detailed groups and portraits. When we accompany
the poet in his career of adventure, it is not enough that he points out
to us, as we go along, the beauties of the landscape, and the costumes
of the inhabitants. The people must do something after they are
described, and they must do it in concert, or in opposition to each
other; while the landscape, with its castles and woods and defiles, must
serve merely as the scene of their exploits, and the field of their
conspiracies and contentions. There is too little connected incident in
Marmion, and a great deal too much gratuitous description.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, we object to the whole plan and conception of the
fable, as turning mainly upon incidents unsuitable for poetical
narrative, and brought out in the denouement in a very obscure,
laborious, and imperfect manner. The events of an epic narrative should
all be of a broad, clear, and palpable description; and the difficulties
and embarrassments of the characters, of a nature to be easily
comprehended and entered into by readers of all descriptions. Now, the
leading incidents in this poem are of a very narrow and peculiar
character, and are woven together into a petty intricacy and
entanglement which puzzles the reader instead of interesting him, and
fatigues instead of exciting his curiosity. The unaccountable conduct of
Constance, in first ruining De Wilton in order to forward Marmion's suit
with Clara, and then trying to poison Clara, because Marmion's suit
seemed likely to succeed with her&mdash;but, above all, the paltry device of
the forged letters, and the sealed packet given up by Constance at her
condemnation, and handed over by the abbess to De Wilton and Lord Angus,
are incidents not only unworthy of the dignity of poetry, but really
incapable of being made subservient to its legitimate purposes. They are
particularly unsuitable, too, to the age and character of the personages
to whom they relate; and, instead of forming the instruments of knightly
vengeance and redress, remind us of the machinery of a bad German novel,
or of the disclosures which might be expected on the trial of a
pettifogging attorney. The obscurity and intricacy which they
communicate to the whole story, must be very painfully felt by every
reader who tries to comprehend it; and is prodigiously increased by the
very clumsy and inartificial manner in which the denouement is
ultimately brought about by the author. Three several attempts are made
by three several persons to beat into the head of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> reader the
evidence of De Wilton's innocence, and of Marmion's guilt; first, by
Constance in her dying speech and confession; secondly, by the abbess in
her conference with De Wilton; and, lastly, by this injured innocent
himself, on disclosing himself to Clara in the castle of Lord Angus.
After all, the precise nature of the plot and the detection is very
imperfectly explained, and we will venture to say, is not fully
understood by one half those who have fairly read through every word of
the quarto now before us. We would object, on the same grounds, to the
whole scenery of Constance's condemnation. The subterranean chamber,
with its low arches, massive walls, and silent monks with smoky
torches,&mdash;its old chandelier in an iron chain,&mdash;the stern abbots and
haughty prioresses, with their flowing black dresses, and book of
statutes laid on an iron table, are all images borrowed from the novels
of Mrs Ratcliffe [<i>sic</i>] and her imitators. The public, we believe, has
now supped full of this sort of horrors; or, if any effect is still to
be produced by their exhibition, it may certainly be produced at too
cheap a rate, to be worthy the ambition of a poet of original
imagination.</p>

<p>In the third place, we object to the extreme and monstrous improbability
of almost all the incidents which go to the composition of this fable.
We know very well that poetry does not describe what is ordinary; but
the marvellous, in which it is privileged to indulge, is the marvellous
of performance, and not of accident. One extraordinary rencontre or
opportune coincidence may be permitted, perhaps, to bring the parties
together, and wind up matters for the catastrophe; but a writer who gets
through the whole business of his poem, by a series of lucky hits and
incalculable chances, certainly manages matters in a very economical way
for his judgment and invention, and will probably be found to have
consulted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> his own ease, rather than the delight of his readers. Now,
the whole story of Marmion seems to us to turn upon a tissue of such
incredible accidents. In the first place, it was totally beyond all
calculation, that Marmion and De Wilton should meet, by pure chance, at
Norham, on the only night which either of them could spend in that
fortress. In the next place, it is almost totally incredible that the
former should not recognize his antient rival and antagonist, merely
because he had assumed a palmer's habit, and lost a little flesh and
colour in his travels. He appears unhooded, and walks and speaks before
him; and, as near as we can guess, it could not be more than a year
since they had entered the lists against each other. Constance, at her
death, says she had lived but three years with Marmion; and, it was not
till he tired of her, that he aspired to Clara, or laid plots against De
Wilton. It is equally inconceivable that De Wilton should have taken
upon himself the friendly office of a guide to his arch enemy, and
discharged it quietly and faithfully, without seeking, or apparently
thinking of any opportunity of disclosure or revenge. So far from
meditating anything of the sort, he makes two several efforts to leave
him, when it appears that his services are no longer indispensable. If
his accidental meeting, and continued association with Marmion, be
altogether unnatural, it must appear still more extraordinary, that he
should afterwards meet with the Lady Clare, his adored mistress, and the
Abbess of Whitby, who had in her pocket the written proofs of his
innocence, in consequence of an occurrence equally accidental. These two
ladies, the only two persons in the universe whom it was of any
consequence to him to meet, are captured in their voyage from Holy Isle,
and brought to Edinburgh, by the luckiest accident in the world, the
very day that De Wilton and Marmion make their entry into it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> Nay, the
king, without knowing that they are at all of his acquaintance, happens
to appoint them lodgings in the same stair-case, and to make them travel
under his escort! We pass the night combat at Gifford, in which Marmion
knows his opponent by moonlight, though he never could guess at him in
sunshine; and all the inconsistencies of his dilatory wooing of Lady
Clare. Those, and all the prodigies and miracles of the story, we can
excuse, as within the privilege of poetry; but, the lucky chances we
have already specified, are rather too much for our patience. A poet, we
think, should never let his heroes contract such great debts to fortune;
especially when a little exertion of his own might make them independent
of her bounty. De Wilton might have been made to seek and watch his
adversary, from some moody feeling of patient revenge; and it certainly
would not have been difficult to discover motives which might have
induced both Clara and the Abbess to follow and relieve him, without
dragging them into his presence by the clumsy hands of a cruizer from
Dunbar.</p>

<p>In the <i>fourth</i> place, we think we have reason to complain of Mr Scott
for having made his figuring characters so entirely worthless, as to
excite but little of our sympathy, and at the same time keeping his
virtuous personages so completely in the back ground, that we are
scarcely at all acquainted with them when the work is brought to a
conclusion. Marmion is not only a villain, but a mean and sordid
villain; and represented as such, without any visible motive, and at the
evident expense of characteristic truth and consistency. His elopement
with Constance, and his subsequent desertion of her, are knightly vices
enough, we suppose; but then he would surely have been more interesting
and natural, if he had deserted her for a brighter beauty, and not
merely for a richer bride. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> was very well for Mr Thomas Inkle, the
young merchant of London; but for the valiant, haughty, and liberal Lord
Marmion of Fontenaye and Lutterward, we do think it was quite
unsuitable. Thus, too, it was very chivalrous and orderly perhaps, for
him to hate De Wilton, and to seek to supplant him in his lady's love;
but, to slip a bundle of forged letters into his bureau, was cowardly as
well as malignant. Now, Marmion is not represented as a coward, nor as
at all afraid of De Wilton; on the contrary, and it is certainly the
most absurd part of the story, he fights him fairly and valiantly after
all, and overcomes him by mere force of arms, as he might have done at
the beginning, without having recourse to devices so unsuitable to his
general character and habits of acting. By the way, we have great doubts
whether a <i>convicted</i> traitor, like De Wilton, whose guilt was
established by written evidence under his own hand, was ever allowed to
enter the lists, as a knight, against his accuser. At all events, we are
positive, that an accuser, who was as ready and willing to fight as
Marmion, could never have condescended to forge in support of his
accusation; and that the author has greatly diminished our interest in
the story, as well as needlessly violated the truth of character, by
loading his hero with the guilt of this most revolting and improbable
proceeding. The crimes of Constance are multiplied in like manner to
such a degree, as both to destroy our interest in her fate, and to
violate all probability. Her elopement was enough to bring on her doom;
and we should have felt more for it, if it had appeared a little more
unmerited. She is utterly debased, when she becomes the instrument of
Marmion's murderous perfidy, and the assassin of her unwilling rival.</p>

<p>De Wilton, again, is too much depressed throughout the poem. It is
rather dangerous for a poet to chuse a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> hero who has been beaten in fair
battle. The readers of romance do not like an unsuccessful warrior; but
to be beaten in a judicial combat, and to have his arms reversed and
tied on the gallows, is an adventure which can only be expiated by
signal prowess and exemplary revenge, achieved against great odds, in
full view of the reader. The unfortunate De Wilton, however, carries the
stain upon him from one end of the poem to the other. He wanders up and
down, a dishonoured fugitive, in the disguise of a palmer, through the
five first books; and though he is knighted and mounted again in the
last, yet we see nothing of his performances; nor is the author merciful
enough to afford him one opportunity of redeeming his credit by an
exploit of gallantry or skill. For the poor Lady Clare, she is a
personage of still greater insipidity and insignificance. The author
seems to have formed her upon the principle of Mr Pope's maxim, that
women have no characters at all. We find her every where, where she has
no business to be; neither saying nor doing any thing of the least
consequence, but whimpering and sobbing over the Matrimony in her prayer
book, like a great miss from a boarding school; and all this is the more
inexcusable, as she is altogether a supernumerary person in the play,
who should atone for her intrusion by some brilliancy or novelty of
deportment. Matters would have gone on just as well, although she had
been left behind at Whitby till after the battle of Flodden; and she is
daggled about in the train, first of the Abbess and then of Lord
Marmion, for no purpose, that we can see, but to afford the author an
opportunity for two or three pages of indifferent description.</p>

<p>Finally, we must object, both on critical and on national grounds, to
the discrepancy between the title and the substance of the poem, and the
neglect of Scotish feelings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> and Scotish character that is manifested
throughout. Marmion is no more a tale of Flodden Field, than of Bosworth
Field, or any other field in history. The story is quite independent of
the national feuds of the sister kingdoms; and the battle of Flodden has
no other connexion with it, than from being the conflict in which the
hero loses his life. Flodden, however, is mentioned; and the
preparations for Flodden, and the consequences of it, are repeatedly
alluded to in the course of the composition. Yet we nowhere find any
adequate expressions of those melancholy and patriotic sentiments which
are still all over Scotland the accompaniment of those allusions and
recollections. No picture is drawn of the national feelings before or
after that fatal encounter; and the day that broke for ever the pride
and the splendour of his country, is only commemorated by a Scotish poet
as the period when an English warrior was beaten to the ground. There is
scarcely one trait of true Scotish nationality or patriotism introduced
into the whole poem; and Mr Scott's only expression of admiration or
love for the beautiful country to which he belongs, is put, if we
rightly remember, into the mouth of one of his Southern favourites.
Independently of this, we think that too little pains is taken to
distinguish the Scotish character and manners from the English, or to
give expression to the general feeling of rivalry and mutual jealousy
which at that time existed between the two countries.</p>

<p>If there be any truth in what we have now said, it is evident that the
merit of this poem cannot consist in the story. And yet it has very
great merit, and various kinds of merit,&mdash;both in the picturesque
representation of visible objects, in the delineation of manners and
characters, and in the description of great and striking events. After
having detained the reader so long with our own dull re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>marks, it will
be refreshing to him to peruse a few specimens of Mr Scott's more
enlivening strains.</p>

<p>[Quotes over six hundred lines of <i>Marmion</i> with brief comment.]</p>

<p>The powerful poetry of these passages can receive no illustration from
any praises or observations of ours. It is superior, in our
apprehension, to all that this author has hitherto produced; and, with a
few faults of diction, equal to any thing that has <i>ever</i> been written
upon similar subjects. Though we have extended our extracts to a very
unusual length, in order to do justice to these fine conceptions, we
have been obliged to leave out a great deal, which serves in the
original to give beauty and effect to what we have actually cited. From
the moment the author gets in sight of Flodden Field, indeed, to the end
of the poem, there is no tame writing, and no intervention of ordinary
passages. He does not once flag or grow tedious; and neither stops to
describe dresses and ceremonies, nor to commemorate the harsh names of
feudal barons from the Border. There is a flight of five or six hundred
lines, in short, in which he never stoops his wing, nor wavers in his
course; but carries the reader forward with a more rapid, sustained, and
lofty movement, than any Epic bard that we can at present remember.</p>

<p>From the contemplation of such distinguished excellence, it is painful
to be obliged to turn to the defects and deformities which occur in the
same composition. But this, though a less pleasing, is a still more
indispensable part of our duty; and one, from the resolute discharge of
which, much more beneficial consequences may be expected. In the work
which contains the fine passages we have just quoted, and many of nearly
equal beauty, there is such a proportion of tedious, hasty, and
injudicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> composition, as makes it questionable with us, whether it
is entitled to go down to posterity as a work of classical merit, or
whether the author will retain, with another generation, that high
reputation which his genius certainly might make coeval with the
language. These are the authors, after all, whose faults it is of most
consequence to point out; and criticism performs her best and boldest
office,&mdash;not when she tramples down the weed, or tears up the
bramble,&mdash;but when she strips the strangling ivy from the oak, or cuts
out the canker from the rose. The faults of the fable we have already
noticed at sufficient length. Those of the execution we shall now
endeavour to enumerate with greater brevity.</p>

<p>And, in the <i>first</i> place, we must beg leave to protest, in the name of
a very numerous class of readers, against the insufferable number, and
length and minuteness of those descriptions of antient dresses and
manners, and buildings; and ceremonies, and local superstitions; with
which the whole poem is overrun,&mdash;which render so many notes necessary,
and are, after all, but imperfectly understood by those to whom
chivalrous antiquity has not hitherto been an object of peculiar
attention. We object to these, and to all such details, because they
are, for the most part, without dignity or interest in themselves;
because, in a modern author, they are evidently unnatural; and because
they must always be strange, and, in a good degree, obscure and
unintelligible to ordinary readers.</p>

<p>When a great personage is to be introduced, it is right, perhaps, to
give the reader some notion of his external appearance; and when a
memorable event is to be narrated, it is natural to help the imagination
by some picturesque representation of the scenes with which it is
connected. Yet, even upon such occasions, it can seldom be advisable to
present the reader with a full inventory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> the hero's dress, from his
shoebuckle to the plume in his cap, or to enumerate all the drawbridges,
portcullisses, and diamond cut stones in the castle. Mr Scott, however,
not only draws out almost all his pictures in these full dimensions, but
frequently introduces those pieces of Flemish or Chinese painting to
represent persons who are of no consequence, or places and events which
are of no importance to the story. It would be endless to go through the
poem for examples of this excess of minute description; we shall merely
glance at the First Canto as a specimen. We pass the long description of
Lord Marmion himself, with his mail of Milan steel; the blue ribbons on
his horse's mane; and his blue velvet housings. We pass also the two
gallant squires who ride behind him. But our patience is really
exhausted, when we are forced to attend to the black stockings and blue
jerkins of the inferior persons in the train, and to the whole process
of turning out the guard with advanced arms on entering the castle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>And thus a whole Canto is filled up with the account of a visit and a
supper, which lead to no consequences whatever, and are not attended
with any circumstances which must not have occurred at every visit and
supper among persons of the same rank at that period. Now, we are really
at a loss to know, why the mere circumstance of a moderate antiquity
should be supposed so far to ennoble those details, as to entitle them
to a place in poetry, which certainly never could be claimed for a
description of more modern adventures. Nobody, we believe, would be bold
enough to introduce into a serious poem a description of the hussar
boots and gold epaulets of a commander in chief, and much less to
particularize the liveries and canes of his servants, or the order and
array of a grand dinner, given even to the cabinet ministers. Yet these
things are, in their own nature, fully as picturesque, and as
interesting, as the ribbons at the mane of Lord Marmion's horse, or his
supper and breakfast at the castle of Norham. We are glad, indeed, to
find these little details in <i>old</i> books, whether in prose or verse,
because they are there authentic and valuable documents of the usages
and modes of life of our ancestors; and we are thankful when we light
upon this sort of information in an antient romance, which commonly
contains matter much more tedious. Even there, however, we smile at the
simplicity which could mistake such naked enumerations for poetical
description; and reckon them as nearly on a level, in point of taste,
with the theological disputations that are sometimes introduced in the
same meritorious compositions. In a <i>modern</i> romance, however, these
details being no longer authentic, are of no value in point of
information; and as the author has no claim to indulgence on the ground
of simplicity, the smile which his predecessors excited is in some
danger of being turned into a yawn. If he wishes sincerely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> follow
their example, he should describe the manners of his own time, and not
of theirs. They painted from observation, and not from study; and the
familiarity and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of their delineations, transcribed with a
slovenly and hasty hand from what they saw daily before them, is as
remote as possible from the elaborate pictures extracted by a modern
imitator from black-letter books, and coloured, not from the life, but
from learned theories, or at best from mouldy monkish illuminations, and
mutilated fragments of painted glass.</p>

<p>But the times of chivalry, it may be said, were more picturesque than
the present times. They are better adapted to poetry; and everything
that is associated with them has a certain hold on the imagination, and
partakes of the interest of the period. We do not mean utterly to deny
this; nor can we stop, at present, to assign exact limits to our assent:
but this we will venture to observe, in general, that if it be true that
the interest which we take in the contemplation of the chivalrous era,
arises from the dangers and virtues by which it was distinguished,&mdash;from
the constant hazards in which its warriors passed their days, and the
mild and generous valour with which they met those hazards,&mdash;joined to
the singular contrast which it presented between the ceremonious polish
and gallantry of the nobles, and the brutish ignorance of the body of
the people:&mdash;if these are, as we conceive they are, the sources of the
charm which still operates in behalf of the days of knightly adventure,
then it should follow, that nothing should interest us, by association
with that age, but what serves naturally to bring before us those
hazards and that valour, and gallantry, and aristocratical superiority.
Any description, or any imitation of the exploits in which those
qualities were signalized, will do this most effectually.
Battles,&mdash;tournaments,&mdash;penances,&mdash;deliver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ance of damsels,&mdash;instalments
of knights, &amp;c.&mdash;and, intermixed with these, we must admit some
description of arms, armorial bearings, castles, battlements, and
chapels: but the least and lowest of the whole certainly is the
description of servants' liveries, and of the peaceful operations of
eating, drinking, and ordinary salutation. These have no sensible
connexion with the qualities or peculiarities which have conferred
certain poetical privileges on the manners of chivalry. They do not
enter either necessarily or naturally into our conception of what is
interesting in those manners; and, though protected, by their
strangeness, from the ridicule which would infallibly attach to their
modern equivalents, are substantially as unpoetic, and as little
entitled to indulgence from impartial criticism.</p>

<p>We would extend this censure to a larger proportion of the work before
us than we now choose to mention&mdash;certainly to all the stupid monkish
legends about St Hilda and St Cuthbert&mdash;to the ludicrous description of
Lord Gifford's habiliments of divination&mdash;and to all the various scraps
and fragments of antiquarian history and baronial biography, which are
scattered profusely through the whole narrative. These we conceive to be
put in purely for the sake of displaying the erudition of the author;
and poetry, which has no other recommendation, but that the substance of
it has been gleaned from rare or obscure books, has, in our estimation,
the least of all possible recommendations. Mr Scott's great talents, and
the novelty of the style in which his romances are written, have made
even these defects acceptable to a considerable part of his readers. His
genius, seconded by the omnipotence of fashion, has brought chivalry
again into temporary favour; but he ought to know, that this is a taste
too evidently unnatural to be long prevalent in the mod<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ern world. Fine
ladies and gentlemen now talk, indeed, of donjons, keeps, tabards,
scutcheons, tressures, caps of maintenance, portcullisses, wimples, and
we know not what besides; just as they did, in the days of Dr Darwin's
popularity, of gnomes, sylphs, oxygen, gossamer, polygynia, and
polyandria. That fashion, however, passed rapidly away; and if it be now
evident to all the world, that Dr Darwin obstructed the extension of his
fame, and hastened the extinction of his brilliant reputation, by the
pedantry and ostentatious learning of his poems, Mr Scott should take
care that a different sort of pedantry does not produce the same
effects. The world will never be long pleased with what it does not
readily understand; and the poetry which is destined for immortality,
should treat only of feelings and events which can be conceived and
entered into by readers of all descriptions.</p>

<p>What we have now mentioned is the cardinal fault of the work before us;
but it has other faults, of too great magnitude to be passed altogether
without notice. There is a debasing lowness and vulgarity in some
passages, which we think must be offensive to every reader of delicacy,
and which are not, for the most part, redeemed by any vigour or
picturesque effect. The venison pasties, we think, are of this
description; and this commemoration of Sir Hugh Heron's troopers, who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And driven the beeves of Lauderdale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harried the wives of Greenlaw's goods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And given them light to set their hoods.' p. 41.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The long account of Friar John, though not without merit, offends in the
same sort; nor can we easily conceive, how any one could venture, in a
serious poem, to speak of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And <i>warms itself against his nose</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The speeches of squire Blount, too, are a great deal too unpolished for
a noble youth aspiring to knighthood. On two occasions, to specify no
more, he addresses his brother squire in these cacophonous lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>St Anton' fire thee!</i> wilt thou stand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'<i>Stint in thy prate</i>,' quoth Blount, '<i>thou'dst best</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listen to our Lord's behest.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Neither can we be brought to admire the simple dignity of Sir Hugh the
Heron, who thus encourageth his nephew,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;'<i>By my fay</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well hast thou spoke&mdash;say forth thy say.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are other passages in which the flatness and tediousness of the
narrative is relieved by no sort of beauty, nor elegance of diction, and
which form an extraordinary contrast with the more animated and finished
portions of the poem. We shall not afflict our readers with more than
one specimen of this falling off. We select it from the Abbess's
explanation to De Wilton.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'De Wilton and Lord Marmion wooed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clara de Clare, of Gloster's blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Idle it were of Whitby's dame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And down he threw his glove:&mdash;the thing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where frankly did De Wilton own,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Letters that claimed disloyal aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proved King Henry's cause betrayed.' p. 272-274.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In some other places, Mr Scott's love of variety has betrayed him into
strange imitations. This is evidently formed on the school of Sternhold
and Hopkins.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Of all the palaces so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Built for the royal dwelling,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The following is a sort of mongrel between the same school, and the
later one of Mr Wordsworth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And Bishop Gawin, as he rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said&mdash;Wilton, grieve not for thy woes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For He, who honour best bestows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May give thee double.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are many other blemishes, both of taste and of diction, which we
had marked for reprehension, but now think it unnecessary to specify;
and which, with some of those we have mentioned, we are willing to
ascribe to the haste in which much of the poem seems evidently to have
been composed. Mr Scott knows too well what is due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> the public, to
make any boast of the rapidity with which his works are written; but the
dates and the extent of his successive publications show sufficiently
how short a time could be devoted to each; and explain, though they do
not apologize for, the many imperfections with which they have been
suffered to appear. He who writes for immortality should not be sparing
of time; and if it be true, that in every thing which has a principle of
life, the period of gestation and growth bears some proportion to that
of the whole future existence, the author now before us should tremble
when he looks back on the miracles of his own facility.</p>

<p>We have dwelt longer on the beauties and defects of this poem, than we
are afraid will be agreeable either to the partial or the indifferent;
not only because we look upon it as a misapplication, in some degree, of
very extraordinary talents, but because we cannot help considering it as
the foundation of a new school, which may hereafter occasion no little
annoyance both to us and to the public. Mr Scott has hitherto filled the
whole stage himself; and the very splendour of his success has probably
operated, as yet, rather to deter, than to encourage, the herd of rivals
and imitators: but if, by the help of the good parts of his poem, he
succeeds in suborning the verdict of the public in favour of the bad
parts also, and establishes an indiscriminate taste for chivalrous
legends and romances in irregular rhime, he may depend upon having as
many copyists as Mrs Radcliffe or Schiller, and upon becoming the
founder of a new schism in the catholic poetical church, for which, in
spite of all our exertions, there will probably be no cure, but in the
extravagance of the last and lowest of its followers. It is for this
reason that we conceive it to be our duty to make one strong effort to
bring back the great apostle of the heresy to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> wholesome creed of
his instructors, and to stop the insurrection before it becomes
desperate and senseless, by persuading the leader to return to his duty
and allegiance. We admire Mr Scott's genius as much as any of those who
may be misled by its perversion; and, like the curate and the barber in
Don Quixote, lament the day when a gentleman of such endowments was
corrupted by the wicked tales of knight-errantry and enchantment.</p>

<p>We have left ourselves no room to say any thing of the epistolary
effusions which are prefixed to each of the cantos. They certainly are
not among the happiest productions of Mr Scott's muse. They want
interest in the subjects, and finish in the execution. There is too much
of them about the personal and private feelings and affairs of the
author; and too much of the remainder about the most trite commonplaces
of politics and poetry. There is a good deal of spirit, however, and a
good deal of nature intermingled. There is a fine description of St
Mary's loch, in that prefixed to the second canto; and a very pleasing
representation of the author's early tastes and prejudices, in that
prefixed to the third. The last, which is about Christmas, is the worst;
though the first, containing a threnody on Nelson, Pitt, and Fox,
exhibits a more remarkable failure. We are unwilling to quarrel with a
poet on the score of politics; but the manner in which he has chosen to
praise the last of these great men, is more likely, we conceive, to give
offence to his admirers, than the most direct censure. The only deed for
which he is praised, is for having broken off the negotiation for peace;
and for this act of firmness, it is added, Heaven rewarded him with a
share in the honoured grave of Pitt! It is then said, that his errors
should be forgotten, and that he <i>died</i> a Briton&mdash;a pretty plain
insinuation, that, in the author's opinion, he did not live one; and
just such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> encomium as he himself pronounces over the grave of his
villain hero Marmion. There was no need, surely, to pay compliments to
ministers or princesses, either in the introduction or in the body of a
romance of the 16th century. Yet we have a laboured lamentation over the
Duke of Brunswick, in one of the epistles; and in the heart of the poem,
a triumphant allusion to the siege of Copenhagen&mdash;the last exploit,
certainly, of British valour, on which we should have expected a
chivalrous poet to found his patriotic gratulations. We have no
business, however, on this occasion, with the political creed of the
author; and we notice these allusions to objects of temporary interest,
chiefly as instances of bad taste, and additional proofs that the author
does not always recollect, that a poet should address himself to more
than one generation.&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">George Gordon, Lord Byron</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Hours of Idleness: A Series of Poems, Original and Translated</i>. By
<span class="smcap">George Gordon</span>, Lord Byron, a Minor. 8vo. pp. 200. Newark. 1807.</p>

<p>The poesy of this young lord belongs to the class which neither gods nor
men are said to permit. Indeed, we do not recollect to have seen a
quantity of verse with so few deviations in either direction from that
exact standard. His effusions are spread over a dead flat, and can no
more get above or below the level, than if they were so much stagnant
water. As an extenuation of this offence, the noble author is peculiarly
forward in pleading minority. We have it in the title-page, and on the
very back of the volume; it follows his name like a favourite part of
his <i>style</i>. Much stress is laid upon it in the preface, and the poems
are connected with this general statement of his case, by particular
dates, substantiating the age at which each was written. Now, the law
upon the point of minority, we hold to be perfectly clear. It is a plea
available only to the defendant; no plaintiff can offer it as a
supplementary ground of action. Thus, if any suit could be brought
against Lord Byron, for the purpose of compelling him to put into court
a certain quantity of poetry; and if judgment were given against him; it
is highly probable that an exception would be taken, were he to deliver
<i>for poetry</i>, the contents of this volume. To this he might plead
<i>minority</i>; but as he now makes voluntary tender of the article, he hath
no right to sue, on that ground, for the price in good current praise,
should the goods be unmarketable. This is our view of the law on the
point, and, we dare to say, so will it be ruled. Perhaps, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ever, in
reality, all that he tells us about his youth, is rather with a view to
increase our wonder, than to soften our censures. He possibly means to
say, 'See how a minor can write! This poem was actually composed by a
young man of eighteen, and this by one of only sixteen!'&mdash;But, alas, we
all remember the poetry of Cowley at ten, and Pope at twelve; and so far
from hearing, with any degree of surprise, that very poor verses were
written by a youth from his leaving school to his leaving college,
inclusive, we really believe this to be the most common of all
occurrences; that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who are
educated in England; and that the tenth man writes better verse than
Lord Byron.</p>

<p>His other plea of privilege, our author rather brings forward in order
to wa[i]ve it. He certainly, however, does allude frequently to his
family and ancestors&mdash;sometimes in poetry, sometimes in notes; and while
giving up his claim on the score of rank, he takes care to remember us
of Dr Johnson's saying, that when a nobleman appears as an author, his
merit should be handsomely acknowledged. In truth, it is this
consideration only, that induces us to give Lord Byron's poems a place
in our review, beside our desire to counsel him, that he do forthwith
abandon poetry, and turn his talents, which are considerable, and his
opportunities, which are great, to better account.</p>

<p>With this view, we must beg leave seriously to assure him, that the mere
rhyming of the final syllable, even when accompanied by the presence of
a certain number of feet,&mdash;nay, although (which does not always happen)
those feet should scan regularly, and have been all counted accurately
upon the fingers,&mdash;is not the whole art of poetry. We would entreat him
to believe, that a certain portion of liveliness, somewhat of fancy, is
necessary to constitute a poem; and that a poem in the present day, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
be read, must contain at least one thought, either in a little degree
different from the ideas of former writers, or differently expressed. We
put it to his candour, whether there is any thing so deserving the name
of poetry in verses like the following, written in 1806, and whether, if
a youth of eighteen could say any thing so uninteresting to his
ancestors, a youth of nineteen should publish it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Shades of heroes, farewell! your descendant, departing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the seat of his ancestors, bids you, adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad, or at home, your remembrance imparting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">New courage, he'll think upon glory, and you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though a tear dim his eye, at this sad separation,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis nature, not fear, that excites his regret:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The fame of his fathers he ne'er can forget.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That fame, and that memory, still will he cherish,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He vows, that he ne'er will disgrace your renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like you will he live, or like you will he perish;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When decay'd, may he mingle his dust with your own.' p. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now we positively do assert, that there is nothing better than these
stanzas in the whole compass of the noble minor's volume.</p>

<p>Lord Byron should also have a care of attempting what the greatest poets
have done before him, for comparisons (as he must have had occasion to
see at his writing-master's) are odious.&mdash;Gray's Ode on Eton College,
should really have kept out the ten hobbling stanzas 'on a distant view
of the village and school of Harrow.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where fancy, yet, joys to retrace the resemblance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of comrades, in friendship and mischief allied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How welcome to me, your ne'er fading remembrance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which rests in the bosom, though hope is deny'd.' p. 4.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>In like manner the exquisite lines of Mr Rogers, '<i>On a Tear</i>,' might
have warned the noble author off those premises, and spared us a whole
dozen such stanzas as the following.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Mild Charity's glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To us mortals below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shows the soul from barbarity clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Compassion will melt,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where this virtue is felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its dew is diffus'd in a Tear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">Which may soon be his grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green sparkles bright with a Tear.' p. 11.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so of instances in which former poets had failed. Thus, we do not
think Lord Byron was made for translating, during his non-age, Adrian's
Address to his Soul, when Pope succeeded so indifferently in the
attempt. If our readers, however, are of another opinion, they may look
at it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah! gentle, fleeting, wav'ring sprite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend and associate of this clay!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To what unknown region borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou now wing thy distant flight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more, with wonted humour gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But pallid, cheerless, and forlorn.' p. 72.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>However, be this as it may, we fear his translations and imitations are
great favourites with Lord Byron. We have them of all kinds, from
Anacreon to Ossian; and, viewing them as school exercises, they may
pass. Only, why print them after they have had their day and served
their turn? And why call the thing in p. 79 a translation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> where <i>two</i>
words (&#952;&#949;&#955;&#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;) of the original are expanded into four
lines, and the other thing in p. 81, where &#956;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#965;&#967;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#952;' &#8001; &#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;,
is rendered by means of six hobbling verses?&mdash;As to his
Ossianic poesy, we are not very good judges, being, in truth, so
moderately skilled in that species of composition, that we should, in
all probability be criticizing some bit of the genuine Macpherson
itself, were we to express our opinion of Lord Byron's rhapsodies. <i>If</i>,
then, the following beginning of a 'Song of bards,' is by his Lordship,
we venture to object to it, as far as we can comprehend it. 'What form
rises on the roar of clouds, whose dark ghost gleams on the red stream
of tempests? His voice rolls on the thunder; 'tis Orla, the brown chief
of Otihoma. He was,' &amp;c. After detaining this 'brown chief' some time,
the bards conclude by giving him their advice to 'raise his fair locks;'
then to 'spread them on the arch of the rainbow;' and 'to smile through
the tears of the storm.' Of this kind of thing there are no less than
<i>nine</i> pages; and we can so far venture an opinion in their favour, that
they look very like Macpherson; and we are positive they are pretty
nearly as stupid and tiresome.</p>

<p>It is a sort of privilege of poets to be egotists; but they should 'use
it as not abusing it;' and particularly one who piques himself (though
indeed at the ripe age of nineteen), of being 'an infant bard,'&mdash;('The
artless Helicon I boast is youth;')&mdash;should either not know, or should
seem not to know, so much about his own ancestry. Besides a poem above
cited on the family seat of the Byrons, we have another of eleven pages,
on the self-same subject, introduced with an apology, 'he certainly had
no intention of inserting it;' but really, 'the particular request of
some friends,' &amp;c., &amp;c. It concludes with five stanzas on himself, 'the
last and youngest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> a noble line.' There is a good deal also about his
maternal ancestors, in a poem on Lachin-y-gair, a mountain where he
spent part of his youth, and might have learned that <i>pibroch</i> is not a
bagpipe, any more than duet means a fiddle.</p>

<p>But whatever judgment may be passed on the poems of this noble minor, it
seems we must take them as we find them, and be content; for they are
the last we shall ever have from him. He is at best, he says, but an
intruder into the groves of Parnassus; he never lived in a garret, like
thorough-bred poets; and 'though he once roved a careless mountaineer in
the Highlands of Scotland,' he has not of late enjoyed this advantage.
Moreover, he expects no profit from his publication; and whether it
succeeds or not 'it is highly improbable, from his situation and
pursuits hereafter,' that he should again condescend to become an
author. Therefore, let us take what we get and be thankful. What right
have we poor devils to be nice? We are well off to have got so much from
a man of this Lord's station, who does not live in a garret, but 'has
the sway' of Newstead Abbey. Again we say, let us be thankful; and, with
honest Sancho, bid God bless the giver, nor look the gift horse in the
mouth.&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<p>If the object of poetry is to instruct by pleasing, then every poetical
effort has a double claim upon the attention of the Christian observer.
For we are anxious that the world should be instructed at all rates, and
that they should be pleased where they innocently may. We are,
therefore, by no means among those spectators who view the occasional
ascent of a poetic luminary upon the horizon of literature, as a
meteoric flash which has no relation to ourselves; but we feel instantly
an eager desire to find its altitude, to take its bearings, to trace its
course, and to calculate its influence upon surrounding bodies. When
especially it is no more an "oaten reed" that is blown; or a "simple
shepherd" who blows it; but when the song involves many high and solemn
feelings, and a man of rank and notoriety strikes his golden harp, we
feel, at once, that the increased influence of the song demands the more
rigid scrutiny of the critic.</p>

<p>Lord Byron is the author, beside the book before us, of a small volume
of poems, which gave little promise, we think, of the present work; and
of a satyrical poem, which, as far as temper is concerned, did give some
promise of it. It had pleased more than one critic to treat his
Lordship's first work in no very courtier-like manner; and especially
the Lion of the north had let him feel the lashing of his angry tail.
Not of a temperament to bear calmly even a "look that threatened him
with insult," his Lordship seized the tomahawk of satire, mounted the
fiery wings of his muse, and, like Bonaparte, spared neither rank, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
sex, nor age, but converted the republic of letters into one universal
field of carnage. The volume called English Bards and Scotch Reviewers
is, in short, to be considered, among other works, as one of those
playful vessels which are said to have accompanied the Spanish armada,
manned by executioners, and loaded with nothing but instruments of
torture.</p>

<p>This second work was of too sanguinary a complexion to beget a very
pleasant impression upon the public mind; and all men, who wished well
to peace, politeness and literature, joined in the p&aelig;an sung by the
immediate victims of his Lordship's wrath, when he embarked to soften
his manners, and, as it were, oil his tempers, amidst the gentler
spirits of more southern climes. Travelling, indeed, through any climes,
may be expected to exert this mitigating influence upon the mind. Nature
is so truly gentle, or, to speak more justly, the God of nature displays
so expansive a benevolence in all his works; so prodigally sheds his
blessings "upon the evil and the good;" builds up so many exquisite
fabrics to delight the eyes of his creatures; tinges the flowers with
such colours, and fills the grove with such music; that anyone who
becomes familiar with nature, can scarcely remain angry with man. With
what mitigating touches the scenery of Europe has visited our author,
remains to be seen. That he did not disarm it of its force by regarding
it with a cold or contemptuous eye, he himself teaches us&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Our author having re-landed upon his native shores, his first deed is to
present to his country the work before us, as the fruits of his travels.
It is a kind of poetical journal of journeys and voyages through Spain
and Portugal, along the shores of the Mediterranean and Archipelago, and
through the states of ancient Greece. When we speak of journal, we mean
rather to designate the topics of the work than the manner of its
execution; for it is highly poetical. Most contrary to the spirit of
those less fanciful records, his Lordship sublimely discards all facts
and histories; all incidents; A.M. and P.M.; and bad inns and worse
winds; and battles and feasts. Seizing merely upon the picturesque
features in every object and event before him, he paints and records
them with such reflections, moral or immoral, as arise in his ardent
mind.</p>

<p>The "Childe Harolde" is the traveller; and as he is a mighty surly
fellow, neither loves nor is loved by any one; "through sin's long
labyrinth had run, nor made atonement when he did amiss;" as, moreover,
he is licentious and sceptical; Lord Byron very naturally, and
creditably to himself, sets out in his Preface with disclaiming any
connection with this imaginary personage. It is somewhat singular,
however, that most of the offensive reflections in the poem are made,
not by the "Childe," but the poet.</p>

<p>[Here follows a summary of the two cantos, with extensive quotations.]</p>

<p>Having by these extracts endeavoured to put our readers in possession of
some of the finest parts of this poem,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> and also of those passages which
determine its moral complexion, we shall proceed to offer a few remarks
upon its character and pretensions in both points of view.</p>

<p>The poem is in the stanza of Spenser&mdash;a stanza of which we think it
difficult to say whether the excellencies or defects are the greatest.
The paramount advantage is the variety of tone and pause of which it
admits. The great disadvantages are, the constraint of such complicated
rhymes, and the long suspension of the sense, especially in the latter
half of the stanza. The noblest conception and most brilliant diction
must be sacrificed, if four words in one place, and three in another
cannot be found rhyming to each other. And as to the suspension of the
sense, we are persuaded that no man reads a single stanza without
feeling a sort of strain upon the intellect and lungs&mdash;a kind of
suffocation of mind and body, before he can either discover the
lingering meaning, or pronounce the nine lines. To us, we confess that
the rhyming couplets of Mr. Scott, sometimes deviating into alternate
rhymes, are, on both accounts, infinitely preferable. One of the ends of
poetry is to relax, and the artificial and elaborate stanza of Spenser
costs us too much trouble, even in the reading, to accomplish this end.
To effect this, the sense should come to us, instead of our going far
and wide in quest of the sense. In our conception also, the heroic line
of ten syllables, though favourable to the most dignified order of
poetry, appears to limp when forced into the service of sonneteers: and
poems in the metre before us, are, after all, little better than a
string of sonnets; of which it is the constituent principle to be rather
pretty than grand&mdash;rather tender than martial&mdash;rather conceited than
wise&mdash;to keep the sense suspended for eight lines, and to discharge it
with a point in the ninth. These observations are by no means designed
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> apply especially to the author&mdash;the extreme gravity of whose general
manner and matter, in a measure covet the dignity of the heroic line.
But it is this discordancy of measure and subject, together with the
obviously laboured rhymes and the halting of the sense, which in
general, we think, have shut out the Spenserian school from popular
reading, and have caused a distinguished critic<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> to say, that the
"Faiery Queen will not often be read through;" and that, although it
maintains its place upon the shelf, it is seldom found on the table of
the modern library.</p>

<p>Whilst, however, Lord Byron participates in this defect of his great
original, he is to be congratulated, as a poet, but alas! in his
poetical character alone, on much happy deviation from him. In the first
place, he has altogether washed his hands of allegory; a species of
fiction open to a thousand objections. In the next place, he is
infinitely more brief than his prototype. And in the third place, he
philosophizes and moralizes (though not indeed in a very sound strain),
as well as paints&mdash;provides food for the mind as well as the
eye&mdash;kindles the feeling as well as gratifies the sense. Thus far, then,
we are among the admirers of his Lordship. But it is to be lamented,
that what was well conceived is, from the temperament of his mind, ill
executed; that his philosophy is, strictly speaking, "only philosophy so
called;" that the moral emotions he feels, and is likely to communicate,
are of a character rather to offend and pollute the mind, than to sooth
or to improve it. This defect, however, we fear, is to be charged, not
upon the poet, but upon the man, at least upon his principles. But,
whatever be the cause, the consequences are dreadful. Indeed, we do not
hesitate to say, that the temperament of his mind is the ruin of his
poem. We shall take the liberty, as we have intimated, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> touching upon
these defects as moral delinquincies, under another head; but for the
present we wish to notice them merely as poetical errors.</p>

<p>The legitimate object, then, of poetry, as we have said, is to
<i>instruct</i> by <i>pleasing</i>; and, c&aelig;teris paribus, that poem is the best
which conveys the noblest lessons in the most attractive form. If, in
reply to this, it is urged that the heathen poets, and especially Homer,
taught no lesson to his readers; we answer, that he taught all the
lessons which, in his own days, were deemed of highest importance to his
country. The first object of philosophers and other teachers, in those
days, was to make good soldiers, and therefore to condemn the vices
which interfered with successful warfare. Now be it remembered, that the
grand topic of the Iliad is the fatal influence of the wrath of kings on
the success of armies. Its first words are &#924;&#919;&#925;&#921;&#925; &#945;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#949;. Besides
this, the Iliad upholds the national mythology, or the only accredited
religion; and by a bold fiction, bordering upon truth, displays in an
Elysium and Tartarus, the eternal mansions of the good and bad, the
strongest incentive to virtue and penalty to vice. Indeed, that both
this and the Odyssey had a moral object, and that this object was
recognized by the ancients, may be inferred from Horace, who says of
Homer, in reference to the first poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plenius ac melius Chrysippo aut Crantore dicit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And as to the second:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rursum&mdash;quid virtus, et quid sapientia possit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulyssem." Epist. I. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many of the Odes of Horace had a patriotic subject&mdash;his Epistles and
Satires, with those of Juvenal and Per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>sius, were the sermons of the
day. Virgil chiefly proposed to himself to exalt in his hero the
character of a patriot, and, in his fictitious history, the dignity of
his country. If the lessons they taught were of small importance or
doubtful value, or if they often forget to "teach" in their ambition to
"please," this is to be charged rather on the age than on the poet. They
taught the best lessons they knew; and were satisfied to please only
when they had nothing better to do. In modern times, it will not be
questioned that the greatest poets have ever endeavoured to enshrine
some moral or intellectual object in their verse. Milton calls Spenser
"our sage serious Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better
teacher than Scotus or Aquinas." In like manner, the Absalom and
Achitophel, the Hind and Panther of Dryden, the philosophic strain of
Pope, the immortal page of Milton, and the half-inspired numbers of the
Task, are all, in their various ways, attempts of poets to improve or
reform the world. Every species of poetry, indeed, has received fresh
lustre, and even taken a new place in Parnassian dignity, by a larger
infusion of moral sentiment into its numbers. The ancient ballad has
arisen to new dignity through the moral touches, we wish they had been
less rare, of a Scott; and the stanza of Spenser has acquired new
interest in the hands of Lord Byron, from the philosophical air which it
wears. Numbers without morals are the man without "the glory." We
sincerely wish that the moral tone of his Lordship's poem had been less
liable to exception.</p>

<p>His Lordship, we believe, is acquainted with ancient authors. Let him
turn to Quinctilian, and he will find a whole chapter to prove that a
great writer must be a good man. Let him go to Longinus, and he will
read that a man who would write sublimely, "must spare no labour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> to
educate his soul to grandeur, and impregnate it with great and generous
ideas"&mdash;that "the faculties of the soul will then grow stupid, their
spirit will be lost, and good sense and genius lie in ruins, when the
care and study of man is engaged about the mortal, the worthless part of
himself, and he has ceased to cultivate virtue, and polish his nobler
part, his soul." Or, if poetical authority alone will satisfy a poet,
let him learn from one of the finest of our modern poems:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But of our souls the high-born loftier part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' ethereal energies that touch the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceptions ardent, laboring thought intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creative fancy's wild magnificence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the dread sublimities of song:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, Virtue, these to thee alone belong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chill'd, by the breath of vice, their radiance dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brightest burns when lighted at the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like vestal flames to purest bosoms given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindled only by a ray from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the object of poetry, however, is not simply to instruct, but to
"instruct by <i>pleasing</i>," is too obvious to need a proof. However the
original object of measure and rhythm may have been to graft truth on
the memory, and associate it with music; they are perpetuated by the
universal conviction that they delight the ear. Like the armour which
adorns the modern hall, they were contrived for use, but are continued
for ornament.</p>

<p>Assuming this, then, to be a just definition of poetry, we repeat our
assertion, that, in the work before us, the temperament of mind in the
poet creates the grand defect of the poetry. If poetry should instruct,
then he is a defective poet whose lessons rather revolt than improve the
mind. If poetry should please, then he is a bad poet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> who offends the
eye by calling up the most hideous images&mdash;who shews the world through a
discoloured medium&mdash;who warms the heart by no generous feelings&mdash;who
uniformly turns to us the worst side of men and things&mdash;who goes on his
way grumbling, and labours hard to make his readers as peevish and
wretched as himself. The tendency of the strain of Homer is to transform
us for the moment into heroes; of Cowper, into saints; of Milton, into
angels: but Lord Byron would almost degrade us into a Thersites or a
Caliban; or lodge us, as fellow-grumblers, in the style of Diogenes, or
any of his two or four-footed snarling or moody posterity. Now his
Lordship, we trust, is accessible upon much higher grounds; but he will
perceive that mere regard for his poetical reputation ought to induce
him to change his manner. If, as Longinus instructs us, a man must feel
sublimely to write sublimely, a poet must find pleasure in the objects
of nature before him, if he hope to give pleasure to others. Let him
remember, that not merely his conceptions, but his mind and character
are to be imparted to us in his verse. He will, in a measure, "stamp an
image of himself!" The fire with which we are to glow must issue from
him. Till this change take place in him, then, he can be no great poet.
It is Heraclitus who mourns in his pages, or Zeno who scolds, or Zoilus
who lashes; but we look in vain for the poet, for the living fountain of
our innocent pleasures, for the artificer of our literary delight, for
the hand which, as by enchantment, snatches us from the little cares of
life, whirls us into the boundless regions of imagination, "exhausting"
one "world," and imagining others, to supply pictures which may refresh
and charm the mind.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> Lord Byron shews us man and nature, like the
phantasmagoria, <i>in shade</i>; whereas, in poetry at least, we desire to
see them illuminated by all the friendly rays which a benevolent
imagination can impart.</p>

<p>We have hitherto confined ourselves to an examination of the influence
of the principles and temper of this work upon its literary pretensions;
but his Lordship will forgive us if we now put off the mere critic for a
moment, and address him in that graver character which we assume to
ourselves in the title of our work. In truth, we are deeply affected by
the spectacle his poem presents to us. As the minor poems at the
conclusion of the work breathe the same spirit, suggest the same doubts,
and employ the same language with the "Childe Harold" we are compelled
to recognise the author in the hero whom he has painted. In fact, the
disclaimer, already noticed in the Preface, seems merely like one of
those veils worn to draw attention to the face rather than to baffle it:
and in the work before us we are forced to recognise a character, which,
since Rousseau gave his Confessions to the public, has scarcely ever, we
think, darkened the horizon of letters. The reader of the "Confessions"
is dismayed to find a man frankly avowing the most disgraceful vices;
abandoning them, not upon principle, but merely because they have ceased
to gratify; prepared to return to them if they promise to reward him
better; without natural affection, neither loving, nor beloved by any;
without peace, without hope, "without God in the world." When we search
into the mysterious cause of this autobiographical phenomenon, we at
once discover that Rousseau's immeasurable vanity betrayed him into a
belief, that even his vices would vanish in the blaze of his
excellencies; and that the world would worship him, as idolaters do
their mishapen gods, in spite of their ugliness. The confes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>sions of
Lord Byron, we regret to say, bear something of an analogy to those of
the philosopher of Geneva. Are they, then, to be traced to the <i>same
source</i>? He plainly is far from indifferent to the opinion of
by-standers: can he, then, conceive that this peep into the window of
his breast must not revolt every virtuous eye? Can he boldly proclaim
his violations of decency and of sobriety; his common contempt for all
modifications of religion; his monstrous belief in the universal rest or
annihilation of man in a future state; and forget that he is one of
those who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Play such tricks before high heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As make the angels weep;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as offend against all moral taste; as attempt to shake the very pillars
of domestic happiness and of public security?</p>

<p>It is, however, a matter of congratulation, that his Lordship, in common
with the republican Confessor, has not revealed his creed without very
honestly displaying the influence of this creed upon his own mind. We
should not, indeed, have credited a man of his sentiments, had he
assured us he was happy: happiness takes no root in such soils. But it
is still better to have his own testimony to the unmixed misery of
licentiousness and unbelief. It is almost comforting to be told, if we
dared to draw comfort out of the well of another man's miseries, that</p>

<span class="i2">The heart&mdash;the heart is lonely still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is consolatory also to contrast the peace and triumph of the dying
Christian, with the awful uncertainty, or rather the sullen despair,
which breathe in these verses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

avowal of an apostle of the opposite system.</p>

</div></div>

<p>But whilst, for the benefit of others, we thus avail ourselves of the
antidote supplied by his Lordship to his own poison, we would wish also
that he might feel the efficacy of it himself. Could we hope that so
humble a work as this would reach the lofty sphere in which he moves, we
would solemnly say to him: "You are wretched, but will nothing make you
happy? You hate all men; will nothing warm you with new feelings? You
are (as you say) hated by all; will nothing make you an object of
affection? Suppose yourself the victim of some disease, which resisted
many ordinary applications; but that all who used one medicine uniformly
pronounced themselves cured:&mdash;would it be worthy of a philosopher not
merely to neglect the remedy, but to traduce it? Such, however, my Lord,
is the fatuity of your own conduct as to the religion of Christ.
Thousands, as wretched as yourself, have found 'a Comforter' in Him;
thousands, having stepped into these waters, have been healed of their
disease; thousands, touching the hem of His garment, have found 'virtue
go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> out of it.' Beggared then of every other resource, try this.
'Acquaint yourself with God, and be at peace.'" His Lordship may
designate this language by that expressive monosyllable, cant; and may
possibly, before long, hunt us down, as a sort of mad March hare, with
the blood-hounds of his angry muse. But we hope better things of him. We
assure him, that, whatever may be true of others, we do not "hate him."
As Christians, even he who professes to be unchristian is dear to us. We
regard the waste of his fine talents, and the laboured suppression and
apparent extinction of his better feelings, with the deepest
commiseration and sorrow. We long to see him escape from the black cloud
which, by what may fairly be called his "black art," he has conjured up
around himself. We hope to know him as a future buttress of his shaken
country, and as a friend of his yet "unknown God." Should this change,
by the mercy of God, take place, what pangs would many passages of his
present work cost him! Happy should we be, could we persuade him, in the
bare anticipation of such a change, even now to contrive for his future
happiness, by expunging sentiments that would then so much embitter it.
Should he never change; yet, such an act would prove, that, at least, he
meditated no cruel invasion upon the joys of others. Even Rousseau
taught his child religion, as a delusion essential to happiness. The
philosophic Tully also, if a belief in futurity were an error, deemed it
one with which it was impossible to part. Let the author then, at all
events, leave us in unmolested possession of our supposed privileges.
<i>He</i> plainly knows no noble or "royal way" to happiness. <i>We</i> find in
religion a bark that rides the waves in every storm; a sun that never
goes down; a living fountain of waters. Religion is suffered to change
its aspect and influence according to the eye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> and faith of the
examiner. Like one side of the pillar of the wilderness, it may merely
darken and perplex his Lordship's path: to millions it is like the
opposite side of that pillar to the Israelites, the symbol of Deity; the
pillar of hallowed flame, which lights and guides, and cheers them as
they toil onward through the pilgrimage of life. Could we hear any voice
proclaim of him, as of one reclaimed from as inveterate, though more
honest, prejudices, "behold, he prayeth;" we should hope that here also
the scales would drop from the eyes, and his Lordship become an eloquent
defender and promulgator of the religion which he now scorns.&mdash;<i>The
Christian Observer</i>.</p>

we did not obtain a clue to their sublime obscurity, till an address to

We perceive, through the "darkness visible" in which Mr. Shelley veils

<p>There has lately arisen a new-fangled style of poetry, facetiously
yclept the Cockney School, that it would really be worth any one's while
to enter as a candidate. The qualifications are so easy, that he need
never doubt the chance of his success, for he has only to knock, and it
shall be opened unto him. The principal requisites for admission, in a
literary point of view, are as follows. First, an inordinate share of
affectation and conceit, with a few occasional good things sprinkled,
like green spots of verdure in a wilderness, with a "parc&acirc; quod satis
est manu." Secondly, a prodigious quantity of assurance, that neither
God nor man can daunt, founded on the honest principle of "who is like
unto me?" and lastly, a contempt for all institutions, moral and divine,
with secret yearnings for aught that is degrading to human nature, or
revolting to decency. These qualifications ensured, a regular initiation
into the Cockney mysteries follows as a matter of course, and the novice
enlists himself under their banners, proud of his newly-acquired honors,
and starched up to the very throat in all the prim stiffness of his
intellect. A few symptoms of this literary malady appeared as early as
the year 1795, but it then assumed the guise of simplicity and pathos.
It was a poetical Lord Fanny. It wept its pretty self to death by
murmuring brooks, and rippling cascades, it heaved delicious sighs over
sentimental lambs, and love-lorn sheep, apostrophized donkies in the
innocence of prim&aelig;val nature; sung tender songs to tender nightingales;
went to bed without a candle, that it might gaze on the chubby faces of
the stars;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> discoursed sweet nothings to all who would listen to its
nonsense; and displayed (<i>horrendum dictu</i>) the acute profundity of its
grief in ponderous folios and spiral duodecimos. The literary world,
little suspecting the dangerous consequences of this distressing malady,
suffered it to germinate in silence; and not until they became
thoroughly convinced that the disorder was of an epidemical nature, did
they start from their long continued lethargy. But it was then too late!
The evil was incurable; it branched out into the most vigorous
ramifications, and following the scriptural admonition, "Increase and
multiply," disseminated its poetry and its prose throughout a great part
of England. As a dog, when once completely mad, is never satisfied until
he has bitten half a dozen more, so the Cockney professors, in laudable
zeal for the propagation of their creed, were never at rest until they
had spread their own doctrines around them. They stood on the house tops
and preached, 'till of a verity they were black in the face with the
heating quality of their arguments; they stationed themselves by the bye
roads and hedges, to discuss the beauties of the country; they looked
out from their garrett [<i>sic</i>] windows in Grub-street, and exclaimed,
"<i>O! rus, quando ego te aspiciam</i>;" and gave such afflicting tokens of
insanity, that the different reviewers and satirists of the day kindly
laced them in the strait jackets of their criticism. "But all this
availeth <i>us</i> nothing," exclaimed the critics, "so long as <i>we</i> see
Mordecai the Jew sitting at the gate of the Temple; that is to say, as
long as there is one Cockney pericranium left unscalped by the tomahawks
of our satire." But notwithstanding the strenuous exertions of all those
whose brains have not been cast in the mould of this new species of
intellectual dandyism, the evil has been daily and even hourly
increasing; and so prodigious is the progressive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> ratio of its march,
that the <i>worthy</i> Society for the Suppression of Vice should be called
upon to eradicate it. It now no longer masks its real intentions under
affected purity of sentiment; its countenance has recently acquired a
considerable addition of brass, the glitter of which has often been
mistaken for sterling coin, and incest, adultery, murder, blasphemy, are
among other favorite topics of its discussion. It seems to delight in an
utter perversion of all moral, intellectual, and religious qualities. It
gluts over the monstrous deformities of nature; finds gratification in
proportion to the magnitude of the crime it extolls; and sees no virtue
but in vice; no sin, but in true feeling. Like poor Tom, in Lear, whom
the foul fiend has possessed for many a day, it will run through
ditches, through quagmires, and through bogs, to see a man stand on his
head for the exact space of half an hour. Ask the reason of this raging
appetite for eccentricity, the answer is, such a thing is out of the
beaten track of manhood, <i>ergo</i>, it is praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Among the professors of the Cockney school, Mr. Percy Bysshe Shell[e]y
is one of the most conspicuous. With more fervid imagination and
splendid talents than nine-tenths of the community, he yet prostitutes
those talents by the utter degradation to which he unequivocally
consigns them. His Rosalind and Helen, his Revolt of Islam, and his
Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude, while they possess beauties of a
superior order, are lamentably deficient in morality and religion. The
doctrines they inculcate are of the most evil tendency; the characters
they depict are of the most horrible description; but in the midst of
these disgraceful passages, there are beauties of such exquisite, such
redeeming qualities, that we adore while we pity&mdash;we admire while we
execrate&mdash;and are tempted to exclaim with the last of the Romans, "Oh!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
what a fall is <i>here</i>, my countrymen." In the modern Eclogue of Rosalind
and Helen in particular, there is a pensive sadness, a delicious
melancholy, nurst in the purest, the deepest recesses of the heart, and
springing up like a fountain in the desert, that pervades the poem, and
forms its principal attraction. The rich yet delicate imagery that is
every where scattered over it, is like the glowing splendor of the
setting sun, when he retires to rest, amid the blessings of exulting
nature. It is the balmy breath of the summer breeze, the twilight's last
and holiest sigh. In the dramatic poem before us, the interest is of a
different nature; it is dark&mdash;wild, and unearthly. The characters that
appear in it are of no mortal stamp; they are d&aelig;mons in human guise,
inscrutable in their actions, subtle in their revenge. Each has his
smile of awful meaning&mdash;his purport of hellish tendency. The tempest
that rages in his bosom is irrepressible but by death. The phrenzied
groan that diseased imagination extorts from his perverted soul, is as
the thunder-clap that reverberates amid the cloud-capt summits of the
Alps. It is the storm that convulses all nature&mdash;that lays bare the face
of heaven, and gives transient glimpses of destruction yet to be. Then
in the midst of all these accumulated horrors comes the gentle Beatrice,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who in the gentleness of thy sweet youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast never trodden on a worm, or bruised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living flower, but thou hast pitied it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With needless tears." Page 50.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She walks in the light of innocence; in the unclouded sunshine of
loveliness and modesty; but her felicity is transient as the calm that
precedes the tempest; and in the very whispers of her virtue, you hear
the indistinct muttering of the distant thunder. She is conceived in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> true master spirit of genius; and in the very instant of her
parricide, comes home to our imagination fresh in the spring time of
innocence&mdash;hallowed in the deepest recesses of melancholy. But
notwithstanding all these transcendant qualities, there are numerous
passages that warrant our introductory observations respecting the
Cockney school, and plunge "full fathom five," into the profoundest
depths of the Bathos. While, therefore, we do justice to the abilities
of the author, we shall bestow a passing smile or two on his unfortunate
Cockney propensities.</p>

<p>The following are the principal incidents of the play. Count Cenci, the
<i>d&aelig;mon</i> of the piece, delighted with the intelligence of the death of
two of his sons, recounts at a large assembly, specially invited for the
purpose, the circumstances of the dreadful transaction. Lucretia, his
wife, Beatrice, his daughter, and the other guests, are of course
startled at his transports; but when they hear his awful imprecations,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, thou bright wine whose purple splendor leaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bubbles gaily in this golden bowl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the lamp light, as my spirits do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the death of my accursed sons!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could I believe thou wert their mingled blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then would I taste thee like a sacrament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pledge with thee the mighty Devil in Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if a father's curses, as men say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Climb with swift wings after their children's souls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drag them from the very throne of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now triumphs in my triumph!&mdash;But thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Superfluous; I have drunken deep of joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will taste no other wine tonight&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>their horror induces them to leave the room. Beatrice, in the meantime,
who has been rating her parent for his cruelty, is subjected to every
species of insult; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> sends her to her own apartment, with the
hellish intention of prostituting her innocence, and contaminating, as
he pithily expresses it, "both body and soul." The second act introduces
us to a t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te between Bernardo (another of Cenci's sons) and
Lucretia; when their conference is suddenly broken off, by the abrupt
entrance of Beatrice, who has escaped from the pursuit of the Count. She
recapitulates the injuries she has received from her father, the most
atrocious of which appear to be, that he has given them all "ditch
water" to drink, and "buffalos" to eat. But before we proceed further,
we have a word or two respecting this same ditch water, and buffalo's
flesh, which we shall mention, as a piece of advice to the author. It is
well known, we believe, in a case of lunacy, that the first thing
considered is, whether the patient has done any thing sufficiently
foolish, to induce his relatives to apply for a statute against him: now
any malicious, evil-minded person, were he so disposed, might make
successful application to the court against the luckless author of the
<i>Cenci, a tragedy in five acts</i>. Upon which the judge with all the
solemnity suitable to so melancholy a circumstance as the decay of the
mental faculties, would ask for proofs of the defendant's lunacy; upon
which the plaintiff would produce the affecting episode of the ditch
water and buffalo flesh; upon which the judge would shake his head, and
acknowledge the insanity; upon which the defendant would be incarcerated
in Bedlam.</p>

<p>To return from this digression, we are next introduced to Giacomo,
another of Cenci's hopeful progeny, who, like the rest, has a dreadful
tale to unfold of his father's cruelty towards him. Orsino, the favored
lover of Beatrice, enters at the moment of his irritation; and by the
most artful pleading ultimately incites him to the murder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> of his
father, in which he is to be joined by the rest of the family. The plot,
after one unlucky attempt, succeeds; and at the moment of its
accomplishment, is discovered by a messenger, who is despatched to the
lonely castle of Petrella (one of the Count's family residences), with a
summons of attendance from the Pope. We need hardly say that the
criminals are condemned; and not even the lovely Beatrice is able to
escape the punishment of the law. The agitation she experiences after
the commission of the incest, is powerfully descriptive.</p>

<p>At first she concludes that she is mad; but then pathetically checks
herself by saying, "No, I am dead." Lucretia naturally enough inquires
into the cause of her disquietude, and but too soon discovers, by the
broken hints of the victim, the source of her mental agitation.
Terrified at their defenceless state, they then mutually conspire with
Orsino against the Count; and Beatrice pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>poses to way-lay him (a plot,
however, which fails) in a <i>deep and dark ravine</i>, as he journeys to

<p><i>Oh&eacute;! jam satis est!!</i>&mdash;The <i>minuti&aelig;</i> of this <i>affectionate</i> parent's
curses forcibly remind us of the equally minute excommunication so
admirably recorded in Tristram Shandy. But Sterne has the start of him;
for though Percy Bysshe Shell[e]y, Esquire, has contrived to include in
the imprecations of Cenci, the eyes, head, lips, and limbs of his
daughter, the other has anticipated his measures, in formally and
specifically anathematizing the lights, lungs, liver, and <i>all odd
joints</i>, without excepting even the great toe of his victim.&mdash;To proceed
in our review; the dying expostulations of poor Beatrice, are beautiful
and affecting, though occasionally tinged with the Cockney style of
burlesque; for instance, Bernado asks, when they tear him from the
embraces of his sister,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Would ye divide body from soul?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On which the judge sturdily replies&mdash;"That is the headsman's business."
The idea of approaching execution paralyses the soul of Beatrice, and
she thus frantically expresses her horror.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The author, in his preface, observes that he has committed only one
plagiarism in his play. But with all the triumph of vanity, we here
stoutly convict him of having wilfully, maliciously and despitefully
stolen, the pleasing idea of the repetition of "down, down, down," from
the equally pathetic and instructive ditty of "up, up, up," in Tom
Thumb; the exordium or prolegomena to which floweth <i>sweetly</i> and
<i>poetically</i> thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here we go up, up, up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here we go <i>down, down, down</i>!"<br /></span>

<p>In taking leave of Mr. Shelley, we have a few observations to whisper in
his ear. That he has the seedlings of poetry in his composition no one
can deny, after the perusal of many of our extracts; that he employs
them worthily, is more than can be advanced. His style, though disgraced
by occasional puerilities, and simpering affectations, is in general
bold, vigorous, and manly; but the disgraceful fault to which we object
in his writings, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> the scorn he every where evinces for all that is
moral or religious. If he must be skeptical&mdash;if he must be lax in his
human codes of excellence, let him be so; but in God's name let him not
publish his principles, and cram them down the throats of others.
Existence in its present state is heavy enough; and if we take away the
idea of eternal happiness, however visionary it may appear to some, who
or what is to recompence us for the loss we have sustained? Will
scepticism lighten the bed of death?&mdash;Will vice soothe the pillow of
declining age? If so! let us all be sceptics, let us all be vicious; but
until their admirable efficacy is proved, let us jog on the beaten
course of life, neither influenced by the scoff of infidelity, nor
fascinated by the dazzling but flimsy garb of licentiousness and
immorality.&mdash;<i>The London Magazine</i>.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Adonais</span>. <i>An Elegy, on the Death of Mr. John Keats</i>. By P.B. Shelley.</p>

<p>We have already given some of our columns to this writer's merits, and
we will not now repeat our convictions of his incurable absurdity. On
the last occasion of our alluding to him, we were compelled to notice
his horrid licentiousness and profaneness, his fearful offences to all
the maxims that honorable minds are in the habit of respecting, and his
plain defiance of Christianity. On the present occasion we are not met
by so continued and regular a determination of insult, though there are
atrocities to be found in the poem quite enough to make us caution our
readers against its pages. Adonais is an elegy after <i>the manner of
Moschus</i>, on a foolish young man, who, after writing some volumes of
very weak, and, in the greater part, of very indecent poetry, died some
time since of a consumption: the breaking down of an infirm constitution
having, in all probability, been accelerated by the discarding his neck
cloth, a practice of the cockney poets, who look upon it as essential to
genius, inasmuch as neither Michael Angelo, Raphael or Tasso are
supposed to have worn those antispiritual incumbrances. In short, as the
vigour of Sampson lay in his hair, the secret of talent with these
persons lies in the neck; and what aspirations can be expected from a
mind enveloped in muslin. Keats caught cold in training for a genius,
and, after a lingering illness, died, to the great loss of the
Independents of South America, whom he had intended to visit with an
English epic poem, for the purpose of exciting them to liberty. But
death, even the death of the radically presumptuous profligate, is a
serious thing; and as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> believe that Keats was made presumptuous
chiefly by the treacherous puffing of his cockney fellow gossips, and
profligate in his poems merely to make them saleable, we regret that he
did not live long enough to acquire common sense, and abjure the
pestilent and perfidious gang who betrayed his weakness to the grave,
and are now panegyrising his memory into contempt. For what is the
praise of cockneys but disgrace, or what honourable inscription can be
placed over the dead by the hands of notorious libellers, exiled
adulterers, and avowed atheists.</p>

<p>Adonais, an Elegy, is the form in which Mr. Shelley puts forth his woes.
We give a verse at random, premising that there is no story in the
elegy, and that it consists of fifty-five stanzas, which are, to our
seeming, altogether unconnected, interjectional, and nonsensical. We
give one that we think among the more comprehensible. An address to
Urania:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Most musical of mourners, weep anew!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not all to that bright station dared to climb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>happier they their happiness who knew</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose <i>tapers yet burn thro' that night of time</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In which suns perish'd</i>; Others more sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Struck by the <i>envious</i> wroth of man or <span class="smcap">God</span>!!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And some yet live," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now what is the meaning of this, or of any sentence of it, except indeed
that horrid blasphemy which attributes crime to the Great Author of all
virtue! The rest is mere empty absurdity. If it were worth our while to
dilate on the folly of the production, we might find examples of every
species of the ridiculous within those few pages.</p>

<p>Mr. Shelley summons all kinds of visions round the grave of this young
man, who, if he has now any feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> of the earth, must shrink with
shame and disgust from the touch of the hand that could have written
that impious sentence. These he classifies under names, the greater
number as new we believe to poetry as strange to common sense. Those
are&mdash;</p>

<p>We have some idea that this fragment of character is intended for Mr.
Shelley himself. It closes with a passage of memorable and ferocious
blasphemy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"He with a sudden hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which was like Cain's or <span class="smcap">Christ's</span>!!!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What can be said to the wretched person capable of this daring
profanation. The name of the first murderer&mdash;the accurst of God&mdash;brought
into the same aspect image with that of the Saviour of the World! We are
scarcely satisfied that even to quote such passages may not be criminal.
The subject is too repulsive for us to proceed even in expressing our
disgust for the general folly that makes the Poem as miserable in point
of authorship, as in point of principle. We know that among a certain
class this outrage and this inanity meet with some attempt at
palliation, under the idea that frenzy holds the pen. That any man who
insults the common order of society, and denies the being of God, is
essentially mad we never doubted. But for the madness, that retains
enough of rationality to be wilfully mischievous, we can have no more
lenity than for the appetites of a wild beast. The poetry of the work is
<i>contemptible</i>&mdash;a mere collection of bloated words heaped on each other
without order, harmony, or meaning; the refuse of a schoolboy's
common-place book, full of the vulgarisms of pastoral poetry, yellow
gems and blue stars, bright Phoebus and rosy-fingered Aurora; and of
this stuff is Keats's wretched Elegy compiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>We might add instances of like incomprehensible folly from every stanza.
A heart <i>keeping</i>, a mute <i>sleep</i>, and death <i>feeding</i> on a mute
<i>voice</i>, occur in one verse (page 8); Spring in despair "throws down her
<i>kindling</i> buds as if she Autumn were," a thing we never knew Autumn do
with buds of any sort, the kindling kind being unknown to our botany; a
<i>green lizard</i> is like an <i>unimprisoned flame</i>, <i>waking</i> out of its
<i>trance</i> (page 13). In the same page the <i>leprous corpse</i> touched by the
tender spirit of Spring, so as to exhale itself in flowers, is compared
to "<i>incarnations of the stars, when splendour is changed to
fragrance</i>!!!" Urania (page 15) <i>wounds</i> the "invisible palms" of her
tender feet by treading on human hearts as she journeys to see the
corpse. Page 22, somebody is asked to "clasp with panting soul the
pendulous earth," an image which, we take it, exceeds that of
Shakespeare, to "put a girdle about it in forty minutes."</p>

<p>It is so far a fortunate thing that this piece of impious and utter
absurdity can have little circulation in Britain. The copy in our hands
is one of some score sent to the Author's intimates from Pisa, where it
has been printed in a quarto form "with the types of Didot," and two
learned Epigraphs from Plato and Moschus. Solemn as the subject is, (for
in truth we must grieve for the early death of any youth of literary
ambition,) it is hardly possible to help laughing at the mock solemnity
with which Shelley charges the Quarterly Review for having murdered his
friend with&mdash;a critique!<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> If criticism killed the disciples of that
school, Shelley would not have been alive to write an Elegy on

occasions, has treated of the soul, the body, life and death agreeably
to the opinions, the principles, and the practice of Percy Bysshe
Shelley.&mdash;<i>The Literary Gazette</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">John Keats</span></h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><i>Endymion: A Poetic Romance</i>. By John Keats. London. 1818. pp. 207.</p>

<p>Reviewers have been sometimes accused of not reading the works which
they affected to criticise. On the present occasion we shall anticipate
the author's complaint, and honestly confess that we have not read his
work. Not that we have been wanting in our duty&mdash;far from it&mdash;indeed, we
have made efforts almost as superhuman as the story itself appears to
be, to get through it; but with the fullest stretch of our perseverance,
we are forced to confess that we have not been able to struggle beyond
the first of the four books of which this Poetic Romance consists. We
should extremely lament this want of energy, or whatever it may be, on
our parts, were it not for one consolation&mdash;namely, that we are no
better acquainted with the meaning of the book through which we have so
painfully toiled, than we are with that of the three which we have not
looked into.</p>

<p>It is not that Mr. Keats, (if that be his real name, for we almost doubt
that any man in his senses would put his real name to such a rhapsody,)
it is not, we say, that the author has not powers of language, rays of
fancy, and gleams of genius&mdash;he has all these; but he is unhappily a
disciple of the new school of what has been somewhere called Cockney
poetry; which may be defined to consist of the most incongruous ideas in
the most uncouth language.</p>

<p>Of this school, Mr. Leigh Hunt, as we observed in a former Number,
aspires to be the hierophant. Our readers will recollect the pleasant
recipes for harmonious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> sublime poetry which he gave us in his
preface to 'Rimini,' and the still more facetious instances of his
harmony and sublimity in the verses themselves; and they will recollect
above all the contempt of Pope, Johnson, and such like poetasters and
pseudo-critics, which so forcibly contrasted itself with Mr. Leigh
Hunt's self-complacent approbation of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;'all the things itself had wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of special merit though of little note.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This author is a copyist of Mr. Hunt; but he is more unintelligible,
almost as rugged, twice as diffuse, and ten times more tiresome and
absurd than his prototype, who, though he impudently presumed to seat
himself in the chair of criticism, and to measure his own poetry by his
own standard, yet generally had a meaning. But Mr. Keats has advanced no
dogmas which he was bound to support by examples; his nonsense therefore
is quite gratuitous; he writes it for its own sake, and, being bitten by
Mr. Leigh Hunt's insane criticism, more than rivals the insanity of his
poetry.</p>

<p>Mr. Keats's preface hints that his poem was produced under peculiar
circumstances.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Knowing within myself (he says) the manner in which this Poem has
been produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it
public.&mdash;What manner I mean, will be <i>quite clear</i> to the reader,
who must soon perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every
error denoting a feverish attempt, rather than a deed
accomplished.'&mdash;<i>Preface</i>, p. vii.</p></div>

<p>We humbly beg his pardon, but this does not appear to us to be <i>quite so
clear</i>&mdash;we really do not know what he means&mdash;but the next passage is
more intelligible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The two first books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are
not of such completion as to warrant their passing the
press.'&mdash;<i>Preface</i>, p. vii.</p></div>

<p>Thus 'the two first books' are, even in his own judgment, unfit to
appear, and 'the two last' are, it seems, in the same condition&mdash;and as
two and two make four, and as that is the whole number of books, we have
a clear and, we believe, a very just estimate of the entire work.</p>

<p>Mr. Keats, however, deprecates criticism on this 'immature and feverish
work' in terms which are themselves sufficiently feverish; and we
confess that we should have abstained from inflicting upon him any of
the tortures of the '<i>fierce hell</i>' of criticism, which terrify his
imagination, if he had not begged to be spared in order that he might
write more; if we had not observed in him a certain degree of talent
which deserves to be put in the right way, or which, at least, ought to
be warned of the wrong; and if, finally, he had not told us that he is
of an age and temper which imperiously require mental discipline.</p>

<p>Of the story we have been able to make out but little; it seems to be
mythological, and probably relates to the loves of Diana and Endymion;
but of this, as the scope of the work has altogether escaped us, we
cannot speak with any degree of certainty; and must therefore content
ourselves with giving some instances of its diction and
versification:&mdash;and here again we are perplexed and puzzled.&mdash;At first
it appeared to us, that Mr. Keats had been amusing himself and wearying
his readers with an immeasurable game at <i>bouts-rim&eacute;s</i>; but, if we
recollect rightly, it is an indispensable condition at this play, that
the rhymes when filled up shall have a meaning; and our author, as we
have already hinted, has no meaning. He seems to us to write a line at
random, and then he follows not the thought excited by this line, but
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> suggested by the <i>rhyme</i> with which it concludes. There is hardly
a complete couplet enclosing a complete idea in the whole book. He
wanders from one subject to another, from the association, not of the
ideas but of sounds, and the work is composed of hemistichs which, it is
quite evident, have forced themselves upon the author by the mere force
of the catchwords on which they turn.</p>

<p>We shall select, not as the most striking instance, but as that least
liable to suspicion, a passage from the opening of the poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;'Such the sun, the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br /></span>

<p>Here it is clear that the word, and not the idea, <i>moon</i> produces the
simple sheep and their shady <i>boon</i>, and that 'the <i>dooms</i> of the mighty
dead' would never have intruded themselves but for the '<i>fair musk-rose

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>By this time our readers must be pretty well satisfied as to the meaning
of his sentences and the structure of his lines: we now present them
with some of the new words with which, in imitation of Mr. Leigh Hunt,
he adorns our language.</p>

<p>We are told that 'turtles <i>passion</i> their voices,' (p. 15); that 'an
arbour was <i>nested</i>,' (p. 23); and a lady's locks '<i>gordian'd</i> up,' (p.
32); and to supply the place of the nouns thus verbalized Mr. Keats,
with great fecundity, spawns new ones; such as 'men-slugs and human
<i>serpentry</i>,' (p. 41); the '<i>honey-feel</i> of bliss,' (p. 45); 'wives
prepare <i>needments</i>,' (p. 13)&mdash;and so forth.</p>

<p>Then he has formed new verbs by the process of cutting off their natural
tails, the adverbs, and affixing them to their foreheads; thus, 'the
wine out-sparkled,' (p. 10); the 'multitude up-followed,' (p. 11); and
'night up-took,' (p. 29). 'The wind up-blows,' (p. 32); and the 'hours
are down-sunken,' (p. 36.)</p>

<p>But if he sinks some adverbs in the verbs, he compensates the language
with adverbs and adjectives which he separates from the parent stock.
Thus, a lady 'whispers <i>pantingly</i> and close,' makes '<i>hushing</i> signs,'
and steers her skiff into a '<i>ripply</i> cove,' (p. 23); a shower falls
'<i>refreshfully</i>,' (45); and a vulture has a '<i>spreaded</i> tail,' (p. 44.)</p>

<p>But enough of Mr. Leigh Hunt and his simple neophyte.&mdash;If any one should
be bold enough to purchase this 'Poetic Romance,' and so much more
patient, than ourselves, as to get beyond the first book, and so much
more fortunate as to find a meaning, we entreat him to make us
acquainted with his success; we shall then return to the task which we
now abandon in despair, and endeavour to make all due amends to Mr.
Keats and to our readers.&mdash;<i>The Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the manias of this mad age, the most incurable as well as the
most common, seems to be no other than the <i>Metromanie</i>. The just
celebrity of Robert Burns and Miss Baillie has had the melancholy effect
of turning the heads of we know not how many farm-servants and unmarried
ladies; our very footmen compose tragedies, and there is scarcely a
superannuated governess in the island that does not leave a roll of
lyrics behind her in her band-box. To witness the disease of any human
understanding, however feeble, is distressing; but the spectacle of an
able mind reduced to a state of insanity is of course ten times more
afflicting. It is with such sorrow as this that we have contemplated the
case of Mr John Keats. This young man appears to have received from
nature talents of an excellent, perhaps even of a superior
order&mdash;talents which, devoted to the purposes of any useful profession,
must have rendered him a respectable, if not an eminent citizen. His
friends, we understand, destined him to the career of medicine, and he
was bound apprentice some years ago to a worthy apothecary in town. But
all has been undone by a sudden attack of the malady to which we have
alluded. Whether Mr John had been sent home with a diuretic or composing
draught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> to some patient far gone in the poetical mania, we have not
heard. This much is certain, that he has caught the infection, and that
thoroughly. For some time we were in hopes, that he might get off with a
violent fit or two; but of late the symptoms are terrible. The phrenzy
of the "Poems" was bad enough in its way; but it did not alarm us half
so seriously as the calm, settled, imperturbable, drivelling idiocy of
"Endymion." We hope, however, that in so young a person, and with a
constitution originally so good, even now the disease is not utterly
incurable. Time, firm treatment, and rational restraint, do much for
many apparently hopeless invalids; and if Mr Keats should happen, at
some interval of reason, to cast his eye upon our pages, he may perhaps
be convinced of the existence of his malady, which, in such cases, is
often all that is necessary to put the patient in a fair way of being
cured.</p>

<p>The readers of the Examiner newspaper were informed, some time ago, by a
solemn paragraph, in Mr Hunt's best style, of the appearance of two new
stars of glorious magnitude and splendour in the poetical horizon of the
land of Cockaigne. One of these turned out, by and by, to be no other
than Mr John Keats. This precocious adulation confirmed the wavering
apprentice in his desire to quit the gallipots, and at the same time
excited in his too susceptible mind a fatal admiration for the character
and talents of the most worthless and affected of all the versifiers of
our time. One of his first productions was the following sonnet,
"<i>written on the day when Mr Leigh Hunt left prison</i>." It will be
recollected, that the cause of Hunt's confinement was a series of libels
against his sovereign, and that its fruit was the odious and incestuous
"Story of Rimini."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What though, for shewing truth to flattered state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Kind Hunt</i> was shut in prison, yet has he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his immortal spirit been as free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sky-searching lark and as elate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think you he nought but prison walls did see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, so unwilling, thou unturn'dst the key?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In Spenser's halls!</i> he strayed, and bowers fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With daring Milton!</i> through the fields of air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To regions of his own his genius true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The absurdity of the thought in this sonnet is, however, if possible,
surpassed in another, "<i>addressed to Haydon</i>" the painter, that clever,
but most affected artist, who as little resembles Raphael in genius as
he does in person, notwithstanding the foppery of having his hair curled
over his shoulders in the old Italian fashion. In this exquisite piece
it will be observed, that Mr Keats classes together <span class="smcap">Wordsworth, Hunt</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Haydon</span>, as the three greatest spirits of the age, and that he
alludes to himself, and some others of the rising brood of Cockneys, as
likely to attain hereafter an equally honourable elevation. Wordsworth
and Hunt! what a juxta-position! The purest, the loftiest, and, we do
not fear to say it, the most classical of living English poets, joined
together in the same compliment with the meanest, the filthiest, and the
most vulgar of Cockney poetasters. No wonder that he who could be guilty
of this should class Haydon with Raphael, and himself with Spencer
[<i>sic</i>].</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great spirits now on earth are sojourning;<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>The social smile, the chain for Freedom's sake</i>:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo!&mdash;whose steadfastness would never take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A meaner sound than Raphael's whispering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other spirits there are standing apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the forehead of the age to come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, these will give the world another heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other pulses. <i>Hear ye not the hum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of mighty workings?&mdash;&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Listen awhile ye nations, and be dumb.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The nations are to listen and be dumb! and why, good Johnny Keats?
because Leigh Hunt is editor of the Examiner, and Haydon has painted the
judgment of Solomon, and you and Cornelius Webb, and a few more city
sparks, are pleased to look upon yourselves as so many future
Shakespeares and Miltons! The world has really some reason to look to
its foundations! Here is a <i>tempestas in matul&acirc;</i> with a vengeance. At
the period when these sonnets were published Mr Keats had no hesitation
in saying that he looked on himself as "<i>not yet</i> a glorious denizen of
the wide heaven of poetry," but he had many fine soothing visions of
coming greatness, and many rare plans of study to prepare him for it.
The following we think is very pretty raving.</p>

<p>Having cooled a little from this "fine passion," our youthful poet
passes very naturally into a long strain of foaming abuse against a
certain class of English Poets, whom, with Pope at their head, it is
much the fashion with the ignorant unsettled pretenders of the present
time to undervalue. Begging these gentlemens' pardon, although Pope was
not a poet of the same high order with some who are now living, yet, to
deny his genius, is just about as absurd as to dispute that of
Wordsworth, or to believe in that of Hunt. Above all things, it is most
pitiably ridiculous to hear men, of whom their country will always have
reason to be proud, reviled by uneducated and flimsy striplings, who are
not capable of understanding either their merits, or those of any other
<i>men of power</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&mdash;fanciful dreaming tea-drinkers, who, without logic
enough to analyze a single idea, or imagination enough to form one
original image, or learning enough to distinguish between the written
language of Englishmen and the spoken jargon of Cockneys, presume to
talk with contempt of some of the most exquisite spirits the world ever
produced, merely because they did not happen to exert their faculties in
laborious affected descriptions of flowers seen in window-pots, or
cascades heard at Vauxhall; in short, because they chose to be wits,
philosophers, patriots, and poets, rather than to found the Cockney
school of versification, morality and politics, a century before its
time. After blaspheming himself into a fury against Boileau, &amp;c. Mr
Keats comforts himself and his readers with a view of the present more
promising aspect of affairs; above all, with the ripened glories of the
poet of Rimini. Addressing the manes of the departed chiefs of English
poetry, he informs them, in the following clear and touching manner, of
the existence of "him of the Rose," &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"From a thick brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nested and quiet in a valley mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the earth. Happy are ye and glad."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From this he diverges into a view of "things in general." We smile when
we think to ourselves how little most of our readers will understand of
what follows.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>So much for the opening bud; now for the expanded flower. It is time to
pass from the juvenile "Poems," to the mature and elaborate "Endymion, a
Poetic Romance." The old story of the moon falling in love with a
shepherd, so prettily told by a Roman Classic, and so exquisitely
enlarged and adorned by one of the most elegant of German poets, has
been seized upon by Mr John Keats, to be done with as might seem good
unto the sickly fancy of one who never read a single line either of Ovid
or of Wieland. If the quantity, not the quality, of the verses dedicated
to the story is to be taken into account, there can be no doubt that Mr
John Keats may now claim Endymion entirely to himself. To say the truth,
we do not suppose either the Latin or the German poet would be very
anxious to dispute about the property of the hero of the "Poetic
Romance." Mr Keats has thoroughly appropriated the character, if not the
name. His Endymion is not a Greek shepherd, loved by a Grecian goddess;
he is merely a young Cockney rhymester, dreaming a phantastic dream at
the full of the moon. Costume, were it worth while to notice such a
trifle, is violated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> every page of this goodly octavo. From his
prototype Hunt, John Keats has acquired a sort of vague idea, that the
Greeks were a most tasteful people, and that no mythology can be so
finely adapted for the purposes of poetry as theirs. It is amusing to
see what a hand the two Cockneys make of this mythology; the one
confesses that he never read the Greek Tragedians, and the other knows
Homer only from Chapman; and both of them write about Apollo, Pan,
Nymphs, Muses, and Mysteries, as might be expected from persons of their
education. We shall not, however, enlarge at present upon this subject,
as we mean to dedicate an entire paper to the classical attainments and
attempts of the Cockney poets. As for Mr Keats' "Endymion," it has just
as much to do with Greece as it has with "old Tartary the fierce;" no
man, whose mind has ever been imbued with the smallest knowledge or
feeling of classical poetry or classical history, could have stooped to
profane and vulgarise every association in the manner which has been
adopted by this "son of promise." Before giving any extracts, we must
inform our readers, that this romance is meant to be written in English
heroic rhyme. To those who have read any of Hunt's poems, this hint
might indeed be needless. Mr Keats has adopted the loose, nerveless
versification, and the Cockney rhymes of the poet of Rimini; but in
fairness to that gentleman, we must add, that the defects of the system
are tenfold more conspicuous in his disciple's work than in his own. Mr
Hunt is a small poet, but he is a clever man. Mr Keats is a still
smaller poet, and he is only a boy of pretty abilities, which he has
done everything in his power to spoil.</p>

<p>[Quotes almost two hundred lines of <i>Endymion</i> with brief interpolated
comment.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, good-morrow to "the Muses' son of Promise;" as for "the feats
he yet may do," as we do not pretend to say, like himself, "Muse of my
native land am I inspired," we shall adhere to the safe old rule of
<i>pauca verba</i>. We venture to make one small prophecy, that his
bookseller will not a second time venture &pound;50 upon any thing he can
write. It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than
a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to "plasters, pills,
and ointment boxes," &amp;c. But, for Heaven's sake, young Sangrado, be a
little more sparing of extenuatives and soporifics in your practice than
you have been in your poetry.</p>

<p>We have accustomed ourselves to think, perhaps without any good reason,
that poetry was likely to perish among us for a considerable period
after the great generation of poets which is now passing away. The age
seems determined to contradict us, and that in the most decided manner,
for it has put forth poetry by a young man, and that where we should
least expect it, namely, in a prize-poem. These productions have often
been ingenious and elegant, but we have never before seen one of them
which indicated really first-rate poetical genius, and which would have
done honour to any man that ever wrote. Such, we do not hesitate to
affirm, is the little work before us; and the examiners seem to have
felt about it like ourselves, for they have assigned the prize to its
author, though the measure in which he writes was never before (we
believe) thus selected for honour. We extract a few lines to justify our

<p>This is, as some of his marginal notes intimate, Mr. Tennyson's second
appearance. By some strange chance we have never seen his first
publication, which, if it at all resembles its younge[r] brother, must
be by this time so popular that any notice of it on our part would seem
idle and presumptuous; but we gladly seize this opportunity of repairing
an unintentional neglect, and of introducing to the admiration of our
more sequestered readers a new prodigy of genius&mdash;another and a brighter
star of that galaxy or <i>milky way</i> of poetry of which the lamented Keats

the same degree of merit that its more clear-sighted and prophetic

carried it through we know not how many editions; which has placed it on
every table; and, what is still more unequivocal, familiarized it in
every mouth. All this splendour of fame, however, though we had not the
sagacity to anticipate, we have the candour to acknowledge: and we
request that the publisher of the new and beautiful edition of Keats's
works now in the press, with graphic illustrations by Calcott and
Turner, will do us the favour and the justice to notice our conversion
in his prolegomena.</p>

<p>Warned by our former mishap, wiser by experience, and improved, as we
hope, in taste, we have to offer Mr. Tennyson our tribute of unmingled
approbation, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> very agreeable to us, as well as to our readers,
that our present task will be little more than the selection, for their
delight, of a few specimens of Mr. Tennyson's singular genius, and the
venturing to point out, now and then, the peculiar brilliancy of some of
the gems that irradiate his poetical crown.</p>

<p>A prefatory sonnet opens to the reader the aspirations of the young
author, in which, after the manner of sundry poets, ancient and modern,
he expresses his own peculiar character, by wishing himself to be
something that he is not. The amorous Catullus aspired to be a sparrow;
the tuneful and convivial Anacreon (for we totally reject the
supposition that attributes the &#7960;&#953;&#952;&#949; &#955;&#8059;&#961;&#951; &#967;&#945;&#955;&#951; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#957; to
Alc&aelig;us) wished to be a lyre and a great drinking cup; a crowd of more
modern sentimentalists have desired to approach their mistresses as
flowers, tunicks, sandals, birds, breezes, and butterflies;&mdash;all poor
conceits of narrow-minded poetasters! Mr. Tennyson (though he, too,
would, as far as his true love is concerned, not unwillingly 'be an
earring,' 'a girdle,' and 'a necklace,' p. 45) in the more serious and
solemn exordium of his works ambitions a bolder metamorphosis&mdash;he wishes
to be&mdash;<i>a river</i>!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;"><b>SONNET.</b></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'With the self-same impulse wherewith he was thrown'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>a beautiful and harmonious line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'From his loud fount upon the echoing lea:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, with <i>increasing</i> might, doth <i>forward flee</i>'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Every word of this line is valuable&mdash;the natural progress of human
ambition is here strongly characterized&mdash;two lines ago he would have
been satisfied with the <i>self-same</i> impulse&mdash;but now he must have
<i>increasing</i> might; and indeed he would require all his might to
accomplish his object of <i>fleeing forward</i>, that is, going backwards and
forwards at the same time. Perhaps he uses the word <i>flee</i> for <i>flow</i>;
which latter he could not well employ in <i>this</i> place, it being, as we
shall see, essentially necessary to rhyme to <i>Mexico</i> towards the end of
the sonnet&mdash;as an equivalent to <i>flow</i> he has, therefore, with great
taste and ingenuity, hit on the combination of <i>forward flee</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'doth forward flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By town, and tower, and hill, and cape, and isle,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Keeps his blue waters fresh for many a mile.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A noble wish, beautifully expressed, that he may not be confounded with
the deluge of ordinary poets, but, amidst their discoloured and briny
ocean, still preserve his own bright tints and sweet savor. He may be at
ease on this point&mdash;he never can be mistaken for any one else. We have
but too late become acquainted with him, yet we assure ourselves that if
a thousand anonymous specimens were presented to us, we should
unerringly distinguish his by the total absence of any particle of
<i>salt</i>. But again, his thoughts take another turn, and he reverts to the
insatiability of human ambition:&mdash;we have seen him just now content to
be a river, but as he <i>flees forward</i>, his desires expand into
sublimity, and he wishes to become the great Gulfstream of the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>And so concludes the sonnet.</p>

<p>The next piece is a kind of testamentary paper, addressed 'To &mdash;&mdash;,' a
friend, we presume, containing his wishes as to what his friend should
do for him when he (the poet) shall be dead&mdash;not, as we shall see, that
he quite thinks that such a poet can die outright.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Shake hands, my friend, across the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of that deep grave to which I go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake hands once more; I cannot sink<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So far&mdash;far down, but I shall know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy voice, and answer from below!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Horace said 'non omnis moriar,' meaning that his fame should
survive&mdash;Mr. Tennyson is still more vivacious, 'non <i>omnino</i>
moriar,'&mdash;'I will not die at all; my body shall be as immortal as my
verse, and however <i>low I may go</i>, I warrant you I shall keep all my
wits about me,&mdash;therefore'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When, in the darkness over me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The four-handed mole shall scrape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plant thou no dusky cypress tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor wreath thy cap with doleful crape,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But pledge me in the flowing grape.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Observe how all ages become present to the mind of a great poet; and
admire how naturally he combines the funeral cypress of classical
antiquity with the crape hat-band of the modern undertaker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And when the sappy field and wood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grow green beneath the <i>showery gray</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rugged barks begin to bud,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And through damp holts, newflushed with May,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ring sudden <i>laughters</i> of the jay!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Laughter, the philosophers tell us, is a peculiar attribute of man&mdash;but
as Shakespeare found 'tongues in trees and sermons in stones,' this true
poet endows all nature not merely with human sensibilities but with
human functions&mdash;the jay <i>laughs</i>, and we find, indeed, a little further
on, that the woodpecker <i>laughs</i> also; but to mark the distinction
between their merriment and that of men, both jays and woodpeckers laugh
upon melancholy occasions. We are glad, moreover, to observe, that Mr.
Tennyson is prepared for, and therefore will not be disturbed by, human
laughter, if any silly reader should catch the infection from the
woodpeckers and the jays.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then let wise Nature work her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And on my clay her darnels grow,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And tell me'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, what would an ordinary bard wish to be told under such
circumstances?&mdash;why, perhaps, how his sweetheart was, or his child, or
his family, or how the Reform Bill worked, or whether the last edition
of his poems had been sold&mdash;<i>pap&aelig;</i>! our genuine poet's first wish is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And tell me&mdash;<i>if the woodbines blow</i>!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When, indeed, he shall have been thus satisfied as to the <i>woodbines</i>,
(of the blowing of which in their due sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>son he may, we think, feel
pretty secure,) he turns a passing thought to his friend&mdash;and another to
his mother&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If <i>thou</i> art blest, my <i>mother's</i> smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undimmed'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but such inquiries, short as they are, seem too common-place, and he
immediately glides back into his curiosity as to the state of the
weather and the forwardness of the spring&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If thou art blessed&mdash;my mother's smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undimmed&mdash;<i>if bees are on the wing</i>?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No, we believe the whole circle of poetry does not furnish such another
instance of enthusiasm for the sights and sounds of the vernal
season!&mdash;The sorrows of a bereaved mother rank <i>after</i> the blossoms of
the <i>woodbine</i>, and just before the hummings of the <i>bee</i>; and this is
<i>all</i> that he has any curiosity about; for he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then cease, my friend, a little while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may'&mdash;<br /></span>

have picked up from Arist&aelig;us, in the Elysian Fields,' or 'tell you how I
am situated as to my own personal comforts in the world below'?&mdash;oh no&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>'<i>If any sense in me remains!</i>'&mdash;This doubt is inconsistent with the
opening stanza of the piece, and, in fact, too modest; we take upon
ourselves to re-assure Mr. Tennyson, that, even after he shall be dead
and buried, as much '<i>sense</i>' will still remain as he has now the good
fortune to possess.</p>

<p>We have quoted these first two poems in <i>extenso</i>, to obviate any
suspicion of our having made a partial or delusive selection. We cannot
afford space&mdash;we wish we could&mdash;for an equally minute examination of the
rest of the volume, but we shall make a few extracts to show&mdash;what we
solemnly affirm&mdash;that every page teems with beauties hardly less
surprising.</p>

<p><i>The Lady of Shalott</i> is a poem in four parts, the story of which we
decline to maim by such an analysis as we could give, but it opens
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'On either side the river lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long fields of barley and of rye,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Lady of Shalott was, it seems, a spinster who had, under some
unnamed penalty, a certain web to weave.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Underneath the bearded barley,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No time has she for sport or play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A charm&egrave;d web she weaves alway;<br /></span>

<p>Poor lady, nor we either&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>A knight, however, happens to ride past her window, coming</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;'from Camelot;<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i6">Sang Sir Launcelot.'&mdash;p. 15.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lady stepped to the window to look at the stranger, and forgot for
an instant her web:&mdash;the curse fell on her, and she died; why, how, and
wherefore, the following stanzas will clearly and pathetically
explain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A long drawn carol, mournful, holy,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We pass by two&mdash;what shall we call them?&mdash;tales, or odes, or sketches,
entitled 'Mariana in the South' and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> 'Ele&auml;nore,' of which we fear we
could make no intelligible extract, so curiously are they run together
into one dreamy tissue&mdash;to a little novel in rhyme, called 'The Miller's
Daughter.' Millers' daughters, poor things, have been so generally
betrayed by their sweethearts, that it is refreshing to find that Mr.
Tennyson has united himself to <i>his</i> miller's daughter in lawful
wedlock, and the poem is a history of his courtship and wedding. He
begins with a sketch of his own birth, parentage, and personal
appearance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My father's mansion, mounted high,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I was a long and listless boy,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But the son and heir of Squire Tennyson often descended from the
'mansion mounted high;' and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I met in all the close green ways,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The wealthy miller's mealy face,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He, however, soon saw, and, need we add, loved the miller's daughter,
whose countenance, we presume, bore no great resemblance either to the
'mealy face' of the miller, or 'the moon in an ivy-tod;' and we think
our readers will be delighted at the way in which the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>passioned
husband relates to his wife how his fancy mingled enthusiasm for rural
sights and sounds, with a prospect of the less romantic scene of her
father's occupation.</p>

<p>The accumulation of tender images in the following lines appears not
less wonderful:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Remember you that pleasant day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, after roving in the woods,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The poet's truth to Nature in his 'gummy' chestnut-buds, and to Art in
the 'long green box' of mignonette&mdash;and that masterful touch of likening
the first intrusion of love into the virgin bosom of the Miller's
daughter to the plunging of a water-rat into the mill-dam&mdash;these are
beauties which, we do not fear to say, equal anything even in Keats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>We pass by several songs, sonnets, and small pieces, all of singular
merit, to arrive at a class, we may call them, of three poems derived
from mythological sources&mdash;&#338;none, the Hesperides, and the
Lotos-eaters. But though the subjects are derived from classical
antiquity, Mr. Tennyson treats them with so much originality that he
makes them exclusively his own. &#338;none, deserted by</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

which is <i>sixteen</i> times repeated in this short poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She tells her 'dear mother Ida,' that when evilhearted Paris was about
to judge between the three goddesses, he hid her (&#338;none) behind a
rock, whence she had a full view of the <i>naked</i> beauties of the rivals,
which broke her heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die</i>:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the deep mid noon: one silvery cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had <i>lost his way</i> among the pined hills:<br /></span>

<p>In the place where we have indicated a pause, follows a description,
long, rich, and luscious&mdash;Of the three naked goddesses? Fye for
shame&mdash;no&mdash;of the 'lily flower violet-eyed,' and the 'singing pine,' and
the 'overwandering ivy and vine,' and 'festoons,' and 'gnarl&egrave;d boughs,'
and 'tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> tops,' and 'berries,' and 'flowers,' and all the <i>inanimate</i>
beauties of the scene. It would be unjust to the <i>ingenuus pudor</i> of the
author not to observe the art with which he has veiled this ticklish
interview behind such luxuriant trellis-work, and it is obvious that it
is for our special sakes he has entered into these local details,
because if there was one thing which 'mother Ida' knew better than
another, it must have been her own bushes and brakes. We then have in
detail the tempting speeches of, first&mdash;</p>

<p>After such reiterated assurances that she was about to die on the spot,
it appears that &#338;none thought better of it, and the poem concludes
with her taking the wiser course of going to town to consult her swain's
sister, Cassandra&mdash;whose advice, we presume, prevailed upon her to live,
as we can, from other sources, assure our readers she did to a good old
age.</p>

<p>In the 'Hesperides' our author, with great judgment, rejects the common
fable, which attributes to Hercules the slaying of the dragon and the
plunder of the golden fruit. Nay, he supposes them to have existed to a
comparatively recent period&mdash;namely, the voyage of Hanno, on the coarse
canvas of whose log-book Mr. Tennyson has judiciously embroidered the
Hesperian romance. The poem opens with a geographical description of the
neighbourhood, which must be very clear and satisfactory to the English
reader; indeed, it leaves far behind in accuracy of topography and
melody of rhythm the heroics of Dionysius <i>Periegetes</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The north wind fall'n, in the new-starr&egrave;d night.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we must pause to observe a new species of <i>metabol&eacute;</i> with which Mr.
Tennyson has enriched our language. He suppresses the E in <i>fallen</i>,
where it is usually written and where it must be pronounced, and
transfers it to the word <i>new-starr&egrave;d</i>, where it would not be
pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>nounced if he did not take due care to superfix a <i>grave</i> accent.
This use of the grave accent is, as our readers may have already
perceived, so habitual with Mr. Tennyson, and is so obvious an
improvement, that we really wonder how the language has hitherto done
without it. We are tempted to suggest, that if analogy to the accented
languages is to be thought of, it is rather the acute ([&acute;]) than the
grave ([`]) which should be employed on such occasions; but we speak
with profound diffidence; and as Mr. Tennyson is the inventor of the
system, we shall bow with respect to whatever his final determination
may be.</p>

song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallow&egrave;d fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guard it well, guard it warily,<br /></span>

sea&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Crocodiles in briny creeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, and stir not: all is mute.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How admirably do these lines describe the peculiarities of this charm&egrave;d
neighbourhood&mdash;fields of snow, so talkative when they happen to lie at
the foot of the mountain, are quite out of breath when they get to the
top, and the sand, so noisy on the summit of a hill, is dumb at its
foot. The very crocodiles, too, are <i>mute</i>&mdash;not dumb but <i>mute</i>. The

</div></div>

<p>This recipe for keeping a secret, by singing it so loud as to be heard
for miles, is almost the only point, in all Mr. Tennyson's poems, in
which we can trace the remotest approach to anything like what other men
have written, but it certainly does remind us of the 'chorus of
conspirators' in the Rovers.</p>

<p>Hanno, however, who understood no language but Punic&mdash;(the Hesperides
sang, we presume, either in Greek or in English)&mdash;appears to have kept
on his way without taking any notice of the song, for the poem
concludes,&mdash;</p>

<p>We hardly think that, if Hanno had translated it into Punic, the song
would have been more intelligible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The 'Lotuseaters'&mdash;a kind of classical opium-eaters&mdash;are Ulysses and his
crew. They land on the 'charm&egrave;d island,' and 'eat of the charm&egrave;d root,'
and then they sing&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Our readers will, we think, agree that this is admirably characteristic,
and that the singers of this song must have made pretty free with the
intoxicating fruit. How they got home you must read in Homer:&mdash;Mr.
Tennyson&mdash;himself, we presume, a dreamy lotus-eater, a delicious
lotus-eater&mdash;leaves them in full song.</p>

<p>Next comes another class of poems,&mdash;Visions. The first is the 'Palace of
Art,' or a fine house, in which the poet <i>dreams</i> that he sees a very
fine collection of well-known pictures. An ordinary versifier would, no
doubt, have followed the old routine, and dully described himself as
walking into the Louvre, or Buckingham Palace, and there seeing certain
masterpieces of painting:&mdash;a true poet dreams it. We have not room to
hang many of these <i>chefs-d'&#339;uvre</i>, but for a few we must find
space.&mdash;'The Madonna'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The maid mother by a crucifix,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In yellow pastures sunny warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath branch work of costly sardonyx<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sat smiling&mdash;<i>babe in arm</i>.'&mdash;p. 72.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The use of the latter, apparently, colloquial phrase is a deep stroke of
art. The form of expression is always used to express an habitual and
characteristic action. A knight is described '<i>lance in rest</i>'&mdash;a
dragoon, '<i>sword in hand</i>'&mdash;so, as the idea of the Virgin is inseparably
connected with her child, Mr. Tennyson reverently describes her
conventional position&mdash;'<i>babe in arm</i>.'</p>

<p>His gallery of illustrious portraits is thus admirably arranged:&mdash;The
Madonna&mdash;Ganymede&mdash;St. Cecilia&mdash;Europa&mdash;Deep-haired
Milton&mdash;Shakspeare&mdash;Grim Dante&mdash;Michael Angelo&mdash;Luther&mdash;Lord
Bacon&mdash;Cervantes&mdash;Calderon&mdash;King David&mdash;'the Halicarnass&euml;an' (<i>quaere</i>,
which of them?)&mdash;Alfred, (not Alfred Tennyson, though no doubt in any
other man's gallery <i>he</i> would have a place) and finally&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Isa&iuml;ah, with fierce Ezekiel,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Plato, <i>Petrarca</i>, Livy, and Rapha&euml;l,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eastern Confutzee!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We can hardly suspect the very original mind of Mr. Tennyson to have
harboured any recollections of that celebrated Doric idyll, 'The groves
of Blarney,' but certainly there is a strong likeness between Mr.
Tennyson's list of pictures and the Blarney collection of statutes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Statues growing that noble place in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All heathen goddesses most rare,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">All standing naked in the open air!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>In this poem we first observed a stroke of art (repeated afterwards)
which we think very ingenious. No one who has ever written verse but
must have felt the pain of erasing some happy line, some striking
stanza, which, however excellent in itself, did not exactly suit the
place for which it was destined. How curiously does an author mould and
remould the plastic verse in order to fit in the favourite thought; and
when he finds that he cannot introduce it, as Corporal Trim says, <i>any
how</i>, with what reluctance does he at last reject the intractable, but
still cherished offspring of his brain! Mr. Tennyson manages this
delicate matter in a new and better way; he says, with great candour and
simplicity, 'If this poem were not already too long, <i>I should have
added</i> the following stanzas,' and <i>then he adds them</i>, (p. 84;)&mdash;or,
'the following lines are manifestly superfluous, as a part of the text,
but they may be allowed to stand as a separate poem,' (p. 121,) <i>which
they do</i>;&mdash;or, 'I intended to have added something on statuary, but I
found it very difficult;'&mdash;(he had, moreover, as we have seen, been
anticipated in this line by the Blarney poet)&mdash;'but I have finished the
statues of <i>Elijah</i> and <i>Olympias</i>&mdash;judge whether I have succeeded,' (p.
73)&mdash;and then we have these two statues. This is certainly the most
ingenious device that has ever come under our observation, for
reconciling the rigour of criticism with the indulgence of parental
partiality. It is economical too, and to the reader profitable, as by
these means</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'We lose no drop of the immortal man.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other vision is 'A Dream of Fair Women,' in which the heroines of
all ages&mdash;some, indeed, that belong to the times of 'heathen goddesses
most rare'&mdash;pass before his view. We have not time to notice them all,
but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> the second, whom we take to be Iphigenia, touches the heart with a
stroke of nature more powerful than even the veil that the Grecian
painter threw over the head of her father.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;'dimly I could descry<br /></span>

<p>What touching simplicity&mdash;what pathetic resignation&mdash;he cut my
throat&mdash;'<i>nothing more</i>!' One might indeed ask, 'what <i>more</i>' she would
have?</p>

<p>But we must hasten on; and to tranquillize the reader's mind after this
last affecting scene, shall notice the only two pieces of a lighter
strain which the volume affords. The first is elegant and playful; it is
a description of the author's study, which he affectionately calls his
<i>Darling Room</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O darling room, my heart's delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear room, the apple of my sight;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No little room so warm and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein to read, wherein to write.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We entreat our readers to note how, even in this little trifle, the
singular taste and genius of Mr. Tennyson break forth. In such a dear
<i>little</i> room a narrow-minded scribbler would have been content with
<i>one</i> sofa, and that one he would probably have covered with black
mohair, or red cloth, or a good striped chintz; how infinitely more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
characteristic is white dimity!&mdash;'tis as it were a type of the purity of
the poet's mind. He proceeds&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Nor any room so warm and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein to read, wherein to write.'&mdash;p. 153.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A common poet would have said that he had been in London or in Paris&mdash;in
the loveliest villa on the banks of the Thames, or the most gorgeous
chateau on the Loire&mdash;that he has reclined in Madame de Sta&euml;l's boudoir,
and mused in Mr. Roger's comfortable study; but the <i>darling room</i> of
the poet of nature (which we must suppose to be endued with sensibility,
or he would not have addressed it) would not be flattered with such
common-place comparisons;&mdash;no, no, but it is something to have it said
that there is no such room in the ruins of the Drachenfels, in the
vineyard of Oberwinter, or even in the rapids of the <i>Rhene</i>, under the
Lurleyberg. We have ourselves visited all these celebrated spots, and
can testify in corroboration of Mr. Tennyson, that we did not see in any
of them anything like <i>this little room so exquis</i><span class="smcap lowercase">ITE</span>.</p>

<p>The second of the lighter pieces, and the last with which we shall
delight our readers, is a severe retaliation on the editor of the
Edinburgh Magazine, who, it seems, had not treated the first volume of
Mr. Tennyson with the same respect that we have, we trust, evinced for
the second.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I could not forgive the <i>praise</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fusty Christopher!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This leads us to observe on a phenomenon which we have frequently seen,
but never been able to explain. It has been occasionally our painful lot
to excite the displeasure of authors whom we have reviewed, and who have
vented their dissatisfaction, some in prose, some in verse, and some in
what we could not distinctly say whether it was verse or prose; but we
have invariably found that the common formula of retort was that adopted
by Mr. Tennyson against his northern critic, namely, that the author
would always</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;Forgive us all the <i>blame</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But could <i>not</i> forgive the <i>praise</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now this seems very surprising. It has sometimes, though we regret to
say rarely, happened, that, as in the present instance, we have been
able to deal out unqualified praise, but never found that the dose in
this case disagreed with the most squeamish stomach; on the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>trary,
the patient has always seemed exceedingly comfortable after he had
swallowed it. He has been known to take the 'Review' home and keep his
wife from a ball, and his children from bed, till he could administer it
to them, by reading the article aloud. He has even been heard to
recommend the 'Review' to his acquaintance at the clubs, as the best
number which has yet appeared, and one, who happened to be an M.P. as
well as an author, gave a <i>conditional</i> order, that in case his last
work should be favourably noticed, a dozen copies should be sent down by
the mail to the borough of &mdash;&mdash;. But, on the other hand, when it has
happened that the general course of our criticism has been unfavourable,
if by accident we happened to introduce the smallest spice of <i>praise</i>,
the patient immediately fell into paroxysms&mdash;declaring that the part
which we foolishly thought might offend him had, on the contrary, given
him pleasure&mdash;positive pleasure, but <i>that</i> which he could not possibly
either forget or forgive, was the grain of praise, be it ever so small,
which we had dropped in, and for which, and <i>not for our censure</i>, he
felt constrained, in honour and conscience, to visit us with his extreme
indignation. Can any reader or writer inform us how it is that praise in
the wholesale is so very agreeable to the very same stomach that rejects
it with disgust and loathing, when it is scantily administered; and
above all, can they tell us why it is, that the indignation and nausea
should be in the exact inverse ratio to the quantity of the ingredient?
These effects, of which we could quote several cases much more violent
than Mr. Tennyson's, puzzle us exceedingly; but a learned friend, whom
we have consulted, has, though he could not account for the phenomenon,
pointed out what he thought an analogous case. It is related of Mr.
Alderman Faulkner, of convivial memory, that one night when he expected
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> guests to sit late and try the strength of his claret and his head,
he took the precaution of placing in his wine-glass a strawberry, which
his doctor, he said, had recommended to him on account of its cooling
qualities: on the faith of this specific, he drank even more deeply,
and, as might be expected, was carried away at an earlier period and in
rather a worse state, than was usual with him. When some of his friends
condoled with him next day, and attributed his misfortune to six bottles
of claret which he had imbibed, the Alderman was extremely
indignant&mdash;'the claret,' he said, 'was sound, and never could do any man
any harm&mdash;his discomfiture was altogether caused by that damned single
strawberry' which he had kept all night at the bottom of his
glass.&mdash;<i>The Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>That we are behind most even of our heaviest and slowest contemporaries
in the notice of this volume, is a fact for which we cannot
satisfactorily account to ourselves, and can therefore hardly hope to be
able to make a valid excuse to our readers. The truth is, that whenever
we turned to it we became, like the needle between positive and negative
electric poles, so attracted and repelled, that we vibrated too much to
settle to any fixed condition. Vacillation prevented criticism, and we
had to try the experiment again and again before we could arrive at the
necessary equipose to indicate the right direction of taste and opinion.
We will now, however, note our variations, and leave them to the public
judgment.</p>

<p>The first lines of the prologue were repulsive, as a specimen of the
poorest Wordsworth manner and style&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The neighbouring borough with their Institute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which he was the patron. I was there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From college, visiting the son,&mdash;the son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Walter too,&mdash;with others of our set."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "wife and child" of the tenants is hardly intelligible; and the
"set" is but a dubious expression. Nor can we clearly comprehend the
next line and a half&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And me that morning Walter show'd the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greek, set with busts:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>Does this mean that Sir Walter Vivian inhabited a Greek house, and that

</div></div>

<p>Persons conversant with the botanical names of flowers will hardly be
able to realize (as the Yankees have it) the idea of their loveliness;
the loveliness of Hippuris, Dolichos, Syngenesia, Cheiranthus,
Artocarpus, Arum dracunculus, Ampelopsis hederaca, Hexandria, Monogynea,
and the rest.</p>

<p>A good description of the demi-scientific sports of the Institute
follows; but the house company and inmates retire to a ruined abbey:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"High-arch'd and ivy-claspt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of finest Gothic, lighter than a fire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is a curious jumble in company, two lights of altogether a
different nature; but the party get into a rattling conversation, in
which the noisy babble of the College Cubs is satirically characterized:
we</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of college: he had climb'd across the spikes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he had squeez'd himself betwixt the bars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discuss'd his tutor, rough to common men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But honeying at the whisper of a lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one the Master, as a rogue in grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veneer'd with sanctimonious theory."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The dialogue happily takes a turn, and the task of writing the
<i>Princess</i> is assigned to the author, as one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> the tales in the
Decameron of Boccaccio. A neighbouring princess of the south (so the
story runs as the prince tells it) is in childhood betrothed to a like
childish prince of the north:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"She to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was proxy-wedded with a <i>bootless calf</i> [?]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At eight years old."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both grew up, the prince, all imaginative, filling his mind with
pictures of her perfections; but she turning a female reformer of the
Wolstencroft [<i>sic</i>] school, resolved never to wed till woman was raised
to an equality with men, and establishing a strange female colony and
college to carry this vast design into effect. In consequence of this
her father is obliged to violate the contract, and his indignant father
prepares for war to enforce it. The prince, with two companions, flies
to the south, to try what he can do for himself; and in the disguise of
ladies they obtain admission to the guarded precincts of the new
Amazonian league. He, meanwhile, sings sweetly of his mistress&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And still I wore her picture by my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one dark tress; and all around them both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And of his friend&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"My other heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shadow, my half-self, for still we moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together, kin as horse's ear and eye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His evasion is also finely told&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"But when the council broke, I rose and past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the wild woods that hang about the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found a still place, and pluck'd her likeness out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid it on flowers, and watch'd it lying bathed<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In the green gleam of dewy-tassell'd trees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud look'd the lips: but while I meditated<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wind arose and rush'd upon the South,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wild woods together; and a Voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went with it 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Almost in juxtaposition with these beauties, we find one of the
disagreeable blots, so offensive to good taste, which disfigure the
poem. The travellers are interrogating the host of an inn close to the
liberties where the princess holds her petticoated sway:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"And at the last&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer of the vine in all his veins&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He always made a point to post with mares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter and his housemaid were the boys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land, he understood, for miles about<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This is too bad, even for medley; but proceed we into the interior of
the grand and luxurious feminine institution, where their sex is
speedily discovered, but for certain reasons concealed by the
discoverers. Lectures on the past and what might be done to accomplish
female equality, and description of the boundaries, the dwelling place,
and the dwellers therein, fill many a page of mingled excellence and
defects. Here is a sample of both in half a dozen lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"We saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melissa, with her hand upon the lock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rosy blonde, and in a college gown<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That clad her like an April daffodilly</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>As bottom agates seem to wave and float</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In crystal currents of clear morning seas</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Curious contradictions in mere terms, also occasionally occur. Thus, of
a frightened girl, we are told that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"<i>Light</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As flies the <i>shadow</i> of a bird she fled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Events move on. The prince reasons as a man in a colloquy with the
princess, and speaks of the delights of maternal affections, and she
replies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"We are not talk'd to thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will we say for children, would they grew<br /></span>

<p>A song on "The days that are no more," seems to us to be too laboured,
nor is the other lyric introduced, "The Swallow," much more to our
satisfaction. It is a mixture of prettinesses: the first four triplets
run thus, ending in a poetic beauty&mdash;</p>

<p>The prince saves the princess from being drowned, when the secret
explodes like a roll of gun cotton, and a grand turmoil ensues. The
rival kings approach to confines in battle array, and the princess
resumes the declaration of war:&mdash;</p>

<p>Who will question the true poetry of this production, or who will deny
the imperfections, (mostly of affectation, though some of tastelessness)
which obscure it? Who will wonder at our confessed wavering when they

feebleness as in the long account of the <i>emeute</i>? Of the extravagant,

<p>There is talent in this dramatic poem, (in which is attempted a picture
of the mind of this celebrated character,) but it is dreamy and obscure.
Writers would do well to remember, (by way of example,) that though it
is not difficult to imitate the mysticism and vagueness of Shelley, we
love him and have taken him to our hearts as a poet, not <i>because</i> of
these characteristics&mdash;but <i>in spite</i> of them.&mdash;<i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><i>Sordello</i>. By Robert Browning. London: Moxon. 1840.</p>

<p>The scene of this poem is laid in Italy, when the Ghibelline and Guelph
factions were in hottest contest. The author's style is rather peculiar,
there being affectations of language and invertions of thought, and
other causes of obscurity in the course of the story which detract from
the pleasure of perusing it. But after all, we are much mistaken if Mr.
Browning does not prove himself a poet of a right stamp,&mdash;original,
vigorous, and finely inspired. He appears to us to possess a true sense
of the dignity and sacredness of the poet's kingdom; and his imagination
wings its way with a boldness, freedom and scope, as if he felt himself
at home in that sphere, and was resolved to put his allegiance to the
test.&mdash;<i>The Monthly Review</i>.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><i>Men and Women</i>. By Robert Browning. Two Volumes. Chapman and Hall.</p>

<p>It is really high time that this sort of thing should, if possible, be
stopped. Here is another book of madness and mysticism&mdash;another
melancholy specimen of power wantonly wasted, and talent deliberately
perverted&mdash;another act of self-prostration before that demon of bad
taste who now seems to hold in absolute possession the fashionable
masters of our ideal literature. It is a strong case for the
correctional justice of criticism, which has too long abdicated its
proper functions. The Della Crusca of Sentimentalism perished under the
<i>Baviad</i>&mdash;is there to be no future Gifford for the Della Crusca of
Transcendentalism? The thing has really grown to a lamentable head
amongst us. The contagion has affected not only our sciolists and our
versifiers, but those whom, in the absence of a mightier race, we must
be content to accept as the poets of our age. Here is Robert Browning,
for instance&mdash;no one can doubt that he is capable of better things&mdash;no
one, while deploring the obscurities that deface the <i>Paracelsus</i> and
the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>, can deny the less questionable qualities which
characterized those remarkable poems&mdash;but can any of his devotees be
found to uphold his present elaborate experiment on the patience of the
public? Take any of his worshippers you please&mdash;let him be "well up" in
the transcendental poets of the day&mdash;take him fresh from Alexander
Smith, or Alfred Tennyson's <i>Maud</i>, or the <i>Mystic</i> of Bailey&mdash;and we
will engage to find him at least ten passages in the first ten pages of
<i>Men and Women</i>, some of which, even after profound study, he will not
be able to construe at all, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> not one of which he will be able to
read off at sight. Let us take one or two selections at random from the
first volume, and try. What, for instance, is the meaning of these four
stanzas from the poem entitled "By the Fireside"?&mdash;</p>

<p>Do our readers exclaim, "But where's poetry&mdash;the dickens&mdash;in all this
rigmarole?" We confess we can find none&mdash;we can find nothing but a set
purpose to be obscure, and an idiot captivity to the jingle of
Hudibrastic rhyme. This idle weakness really appears to be at the bottom
of half the daring nonsense in this most daringly nonsensical book.
Hudibras Butler told us long ago that "rhyme the rudder is of verses;"
and when, as in his case, or in that of Ingoldsby Barham, or
Whims-and-Oddities Hood, the rudder guides the good ship into tracks of
fun and fancy she might otherwise have missed, we are grateful to the
double-endings, not on their own account, but for what they have led us
to. But Mr. Browning is the mere thrall of his own rudder, and is
constantly being steered by it into whirlpools of the most raging
absurdity. This morbid passion for double rhymes, which is observable
more or less throughout the book, reaches its climax in a long copy of
verses on the "Old Pictures of Florence," which, with every disposition
to be tolerant of the frailties of genius, we cannot hesitate to
pronounce a masterpiece of absurdity. Let the lovers of the Hudibrastic
admire these <i>tours de force</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>How really deplorable is all this! On what theory of art can it possibly
be defended? In all the fine arts alike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>&mdash;poetry, painting, sculpture,
music&mdash;the master works have this in common, that they please in the
highest degree the most cultivated, and to the widest extent the less
cultivated. <i>Lear</i> and the <i>Divine Comedy</i> exhaust the thinking of the
profoundest student, yet subdue to hushed and breathless attention the
illiterate minds that know not what study means. The "Last Judgment,"
the "Transfiguration," the "Niobe," and the "Dying Gladiator" excite
alike the intelligent rapture of artists, and the unintelligent
admiration of those to whom art and its principles are a sealed book.
Handel's <i>Israel in Egypt</i>&mdash;the wonder of the scientific musician in his
closet&mdash;yet sways to and fro, like a mighty wind upon the waters, the
hearts of assembled thousands at an Exeter Hall oratorio. To take an
instance more striking still, Beethoven, the sublime, the rugged, the
austere, is also, as even Mons. Jullien could tell us, fast becoming a
popular favourite. Now why is this? Simply because these master minds,
under the divine teaching of genius, have known how to clothe their
works in a beauty of form incorporate with their very essence&mdash;a beauty
of form which has an elective affinity with the highest instincts of
universal humanity. And it is on this beauty of form, this exquisite
perfection of style, that the Baileys and the Brownings would have us
believe that they set small account, that they purposely and scornfully
trample. We do not believe it. We believe that it is only because they
are half-gifted that they are but half-intelligible. Their mysticism is
weakness&mdash;weakness writhing itself into contortions that it may ape the
muscles of strength. Artistic genius, in its higher degrees, necessarily
involves the power of beautiful self-expression. It is but a weak and
watery sun that allows the fogs to hang heavy between the objects on
which it shines and the eyes it would enlighten; the true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> day-star
chases the mists at once, and shows us the world at a glance.</p>

<p>Our main object has been to protest against what we feel to be the false
teachings of a perverted school of art; and we have used this book of
Mr. Browning's chiefly as a means of showing the extravagant lengths of
absurdity to which the tenets of that school can lead a man of admitted
powers. We should regret, however in the pursuit of this object to
inflict injustice on Mr. Browning. This last book of his, like most of
its predecessors, contains some undeniable beauties&mdash;subtle thoughts,
graceful fancies, and occasionally a strain of music, which only makes
the chaos of surrounding discords jar more harshly on the ear. The
dramatic scenes "In a Balcony" are finely conceived and vigorously
written; "Bishop Blougram's Apology," and "Cleon," are well worth
reading and thinking over; and there is a certain grace and beauty in
several of the minor poems. That which, on the whole, has pleased us
most&mdash;really, perhaps, because we could read it off-hand&mdash;is "The Statue
and the Bust," of which we give the opening stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<p>[Quotes fourteen stanzas of <i>The Statue and the Bust</i>.]</p>

<p>Why should a man, who, with so little apparent labour, can write
naturally and well, take so much apparent labour to write affectedly and
ill? There can be but one of two solutions. Either he goes wrong from
want of knowledge, in which case it is clear that he wants the highest
intuitions of genius; or he sins against knowledge, in which case he
must have been misled by the false promptings of a morbid vanity, eager
for that applause of fools which always waits on quackery, and which is
never refused to extravagance when tricked out in the guise of
originality. It is difficult, from the internal evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> supplied by
his works, to know which of these two theories to adopt. Frequently the
conclusion is almost irresistible, that Mr. Browning's mysticism must be
of <i>malice prepense</i>: on the whole, however, we are inclined to clear
his honesty at the expense of his powers, and to conclude that he is
obscure, not so much because he has the vanity to be thought original,
as because he lacks sufficient genius to make himself clear.&mdash;<i>The
Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Thomas Gray</span></p>

<p>When Gray's <i>Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard</i> appeared in 1751,
the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, IV, p. 309, gave it the following curious
notice:&mdash;"The excellence of this little piece amply compensates for its
want of quantity." The immediate success and popularity of the <i>Elegy</i>
established Gray's poetical reputation; hence his <i>Odes</i> (1757) were
received and criticized as the work of a poet of whom something entirely
different was expected. The thin quarto volume containing <i>The Progress
of Poesy</i> and <i>The Bard</i> (entitled merely Ode I and Ode II in that
edition) was printed for Dodsley by Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill,
and was published on August 8, 1757. Within a fortnight Gray wrote to
Thomas Warton that the poems were not at all popular, the great
objection being their obscurity; a week later he wrote to Hurd:&mdash;"Even
my friends tell me they [the Odes] do not succeed ... in short, I have
heard nobody but a player [Garrick] and a doctor of divinity [Warburton]
that profess their esteem for them." For further comment, see Gray's
<i>Works</i>, ed. Gosse, II, pp. 321-328.</p>

<p>Our review, which is reprinted from <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XVII (239-243)
(September, 1757), was written by Oliver Goldsmith, and is included in
most of the collected editions of his works. Although it was practically
wrung from Goldsmith while he was the unwilling thrall of Griffiths, it
is a noteworthy piece of criticism for its time&mdash;certainly far superior
to the general standard of the <i>Monthly Review</i>. While recognizing the
scholarly merit of the poet's work, Goldsmith showed clearly why the
Odes could not become popular. A more favorable notice of the volume
appeared in the <i>Critical Rev.</i>, IV, p. 167.</p>

<p>In reprinting this review, the long quotations from both odes have been
omitted. This precedent is followed in all cases where the quotations
are of inordinate length, or are offered merely as "specimens" without
specific criticism. No useful end would be served in reprinting numerous
pages of classic extracts that are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> readily accessible to every student.

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Oliver Goldsmith</span></p>

<p>Goldsmith's <i>Traveller</i> (1764) was begun as early as 1755&mdash;before he had
expressed what Professor Dowden calls his "qualified enthusiasm" and
"official admiration" for Gray's <i>Odes</i>. In criticizing Gray, he quoted
Isocrates' advice&mdash;<i>Study the people</i>&mdash;and properly bore that precept in
mind while he was shaping his own verses. The <i>Odes</i> and the <i>Traveller</i>
are respectively characteristic utterances of their authors&mdash;of the
academic recluse, and of the warm-hearted lover of humanity.</p>

<p>The review, quoted from the <i>Critical Rev.</i>, XVIII (458-462) (December,
1764), is from the pen of Dr. Samuel Johnson. Apart from its
distinguished authorship and the strong words of commendation in the
final sentence, it possesses slight interest as literary criticism. It
is, in fact, little more than a brief summary of the poem, enriched by a
few well-chosen illustrative extracts. The fact that Johnson contributed
nine or ten lines to the poem (see Boswell, ed. Hill, I, p. 441, n. 1,
and II, p. 6) may account partly for the character of the review.
Johnson's quotations from the poem are not continuous and show several
variations from authoritative texts.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">William Cowper</span></p>

<p>Cowper stands almost alone among English poets as an instance of late
manifestation of poetic power. He was over fifty years of age when he
offered his first volume of <i>Poems</i> (1782) to the public. This
collection, which included <i>Table-Talk</i> and other didactic poems,
appeared at the beginning of the most prosaic age in the history of
modern English literature; yet the critics did not find it sufficiently
striking in quality to differentiate it from the level of contemporary
verse, or to forecast the success of <i>The Task</i> and <i>John Gilpin's Ride</i>
three years later.</p>

<p>The notice in the <i>Critical Rev.</i>, LIII (287-290), appeared in April,
1782. While the same poems are but slightly esteemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> to-day, it must be
recognized that the attitude of the reviewer was severe for his time.
The age had grown accustomed to large draughts of moralizing and
didacticism in verse, and the quality of Cowper's contribution was
assuredly above the average. The <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, LXVII, p. 262, gave the
<i>Poems</i> a much more favorable reception.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Robert Burns</span></p>

<p>The Kilmarnock edition (1786) of Burns' <i>Poems</i> was published during the
most eventful period of the poet's life; the almost universally kind
reception accorded to this volume was the one source of consolation amid
many sorrows and distractions. Two reviews have been selected to
illustrate both the Scottish and English attitude toward the newly
discovered "ploughman-poet." The <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, IV (284-288), in
October, 1786, gave Burns a welcome that was hearty and sincere; though
we may smile to-day at the information that he has neither the "doric
simplicity" of Ramsay, nor the "brilliant imagination" of Ferguson.
Besides the poems mentioned in brackets, the magazine published further
extracts from Burns in subsequent numbers. The <i>Critical Review</i>, LXIII
(387-388), gave the volume a belated notice in May, 1787, exceeding even
the Scotch magazine in its generous appreciation. With the generally
accepted fact in mind that all of Burns' enduring work is in the
Scottish dialect, and that his English poems are comparatively inferior,
it is interesting to note the <i>Critical Review's</i> regret that the
dialect must "obscure the native beauties" and be often unintelligible
to English readers. The same sentiment was expressed by the <i>Monthly
Review</i>, LXXV, p. 439, in the critique reprinted (without its curious
anglified version of <i>The Cotter's Saturday Night</i>) in Stevenson's
<i>Early Reviews</i>.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no other English poet whose fame was so suddenly and
securely established as Burns'. At no time since the appearance of the
Kilmarnock volume has the worth of his lyrical achievement been
seriously questioned. The <i>Reliques</i> of Burns, edited by Dr. Cromek in
1808, were reviewed by Walter Scott in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> the first number of the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, and by Jeffrey in the corresponding number of the
<i>Edinburgh</i>. Both articles are valuable to the student of Burns, but
their great length made their inclusion in the present volume
impracticable.</p>

and Professor Dugald Stewart, who both took great interest in Burns

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">William Wordsworth</span></p>

<p>The thin quartos containing <i>An Evening Walk</i> and <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>
were published by Wordsworth in 1793. The former was practically a
school-composition in verse, written between 1787-89 and dedicated to
his sister; the latter was composed in France during 1791-92 and was
revised shortly before publication. The dedication was addressed to the
Rev. Robert Jones, fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, who was
Wordsworth's companion during the pedestrian tour in the Alps. Though
<i>An Evening Walk</i> was published first, the <i>Monthly Review</i>, XII, n.s.
(216-218), in October, 1793, noticed both in the same issue and
naturally gave precedence to the longer poem. Specific allusions in the
text necessitate the same order in the present reprint.</p>

<p>The impatience of the reviewer at the prospect of "more descriptive
poetry" was due to the fact that many such productions had recently been
noticed by the <i>Monthly</i>, and that the volumes then under consideration
evidently belonged to the broad stream of mediocre verse that had been
flowing soberly along almost since the days of Thomson. These first
attempts smacked so decidedly of the older manner that we cannot censure
the critic for failing to foresee that Wordsworth was destined to
glorify the "poetry of nature," and to rescue it from the rut of
listless and soporific topographical description. Both poems, in the
definitive text, are readable, and exhibit here and there a glimmer of
the poet's future greatness; yet it must be borne in mind that
Wordsworth was continually tinkering at his verse, to the subsequent
despair of conscientious variorum editors, and that most of the
absurdities and infelicities in his first editions disappeared under the
correcting influence of his sarcastic critics and his own maturing
taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>A collation of the accepted text with the <i>Monthly Review's</i> quotations
will repay the student; thus, the twelve opening lines quoted by the
reviewer are represented by eight lines in Professor Knight's edition,
and only four of these correspond to the original text. The reviewer
confined his remarks to the first thirty lines of the poem and very
properly neglected the rest. He followed, with moderate success, the
method of quotation with interpolated sarcasm and badinage&mdash;a method
that was afterwards effectively pursued by the early Edinburgh Reviewers
and the Blackwood coterie. There are few examples of that style in the
eighteenth century reviews, but some noteworthy specimens of a later
period&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> on Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i> and
the <i>Quarterly</i> on Tennyson's <i>Poems</i>&mdash;are reprinted in this volume.</p>

<p>The review of <i>An Evening Walk</i> is simply an appended paragraph to the
previous article. Wordsworth evidently appreciated the advice conveyed
in the reviewer's final sentence and found many of the lines that
"called loudly for amendment." More favorable notices of both poems will
be found in <i>Critical Review</i>, VIII, pp. 347 and 472.</p>


<h4><i>Lyrical Ballads</i></h4>

<p>The <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> by Wordsworth and Coleridge were published
anonymously early in September, 1798&mdash;a few days before the joint
authors sailed for Germany. Coleridge's contributions were <i>The Rime of
the Ancient Mariner</i>, <i>The Foster-Mother's Tale</i>, <i>The Nightingale</i>, and
<i>The Dungeon</i>; the remaining nineteen poems were by Wordsworth. As the
publication of this volume has been accepted by most critics as the
first fruit of the new romantic spirit and the virtual beginning of
modern English poetry, the reception accorded to the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
becomes a matter of prime importance. It is well known that the effort
was a failure at first and that the apparent triumph of romanticism did
not occur until the publication of Scott's <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>
(1805); but a contemporary blindness to the beauty of two of the finest
poems in English literature cannot be permitted to figure in the
critics' dispassionate investigation of causes and influences.</p>

<p>There were four interesting reviews of the first edition of the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, namely, (1) <i>Critical Rev.</i>, XXIV, n.s. (197-204), in October,
1798, which is reprinted here; (2) <i>Analytical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> Rev.</i>, XXVIII (583-587),
in December, 1798; (3) <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XXIX, n.s. (202-210), in May,
1799, reprinted in Stevenson's <i>Early Reviews</i>; (4) <i>British Critic</i>,
XIV (364-369) in October, 1799.</p>

<p>The article in the <i>Critical Review</i> was written by Robert Southey under
conditions most favorable for such a malicious procedure. The publisher,
his friend Cottle, had transferred the copyright of the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i> to Arch, a London publisher, within two weeks of the appearance
of the volume, giving as a shallow excuse the "heavy sale" of the book.
Both Wordsworth and Coleridge were in Germany. Southey had quarreled
with Coleridge, and was probably jealous of the latter's extravagant
praise of Wordsworth. He accordingly seized the opportunity to assail
the work without injuring Cottle's interests or entailing the immediate
displeasure of the travelling bards.</p>

<p>He covered his tracks to some extent by referring several times to "the
author," although the joint authorship was well known to him. While
severe in most of his strictures on Wordsworth, Southey reserved his
special malice for <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>. He called it "a Dutch attempt
at German sublimity"; and in a letter written to William Taylor on
September 5, 1798&mdash;probably while he was writing his discreditable
critique&mdash;he characterized the poem as "the clumsiest attempt at German
sublimity I ever saw." Southey's responsibility for the article became
known to Cottle, who communicated the fact to the poets on their return
a year later. Wordsworth declared that "if Southey could not
conscientiously have spoken differently of the volume, he ought to have
declined the task of reviewing it." Coleridge indited an epigram, <i>To a
Critic</i>, and let the matter drop. Shortly afterwards he showed his
renewed good-will by aiding Southey in preparing the second <i>Annual
Anthology</i> (1800).</p>

<p>The subsequent reviews of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> adopted the tone of the
<i>Critical</i> (then recognized as the leading review) and internal evidence
shows that they did not hesitate to borrow ideas from Southey's article.
The <i>Analytical Review</i> also saw German extravagances in <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i>; the <i>Monthly</i> borrowed Southey's figure of the Italian and
Flemish painters, and called <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> "the strangest story
of a cock and bull that we ever saw on paper ... a rhapsody of
unintelligible wildness and incoherence." The belated review in the
<i>British Critic</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> was probably written by Coleridge's friend, Rev.
Francis Wrangham, and was somewhat more appreciative than the rest. For
further details, consult Mr. Thomas Hutchinson's reprint (1898) of the
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, pp. (xiii-xxviii). Despite the unfavorable reviews,
the Ballads reached a fourth edition in 1805 (besides an American
edition in 1802), thus achieving the popularity alluded to by Jeffrey at
the beginning of our next review.</p>


<h4><i>Poems</i> (1807)</h4>

<p>Wordsworth's fourth publication, the <i>Poems</i> (1807), included most of
the pieces written after the first appearance of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>.
It was likewise his first venture subsequent to the founding of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>. Jeffrey had assailed the theories of the "Lake
Poets" (and, incidentally, coined that unfortunate term) in the first
number of the <i>Review</i>, in an article on Southey's <i>Thalaba</i>, and three
years later (1805), in criticizing <i>Madoc</i>, he again expressed his views
on the subject. Now came the first opportunity to deal with the
recognized leader of the "Lakers"&mdash;the poet whose work most clearly
illustrated the poetic theories that Jeffrey deemed pernicious.</p>

<p>The article here reprinted from the <i>Edinburgh Rev.</i>, XI (214-231), of
October, 1807, and Jeffrey's review of <i>The Excursion</i>, in <i>ibid.</i>, XXIV
(1-30), are perhaps the two most important critiques of their kind. No
student of Wordsworth's theory of poetry, as set forth in his various
prefaces, can afford to ignore either of these interesting discussions
of the subject. (For details, see A.J. George's edition of the
<i>Prefaces</i> of Wordsworth, Gates' <i>Selections</i> from Jeffrey, Beers'
<i>Nineteenth Century Romanticism</i>, Hutchinson's edition of <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, etc.) It was undoubtedly true that Jeffrey, although an able
critic, failed to grasp the real significance of the new poetic
movement, and to appreciate the influence wrought by the doctrines of
the Lake Poets on modern conceptions of poetry. Yet he was far from
wrong in many of his criticisms of Wordsworth. While deprecating the
latter's theories, it is clear that Jeffrey regarded him as a poet of
great power who was being led astray by his perverse practice. The
popular conception of Jeffrey as a hectoring and blatant opponent of
Wordsworth is not substantiated by the review. The impartial reader must
agree with Jeffrey at many points, and if he will take the trouble to
collate Jeffrey's quotations with the revised text<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> of Wordsworth, he
will learn that the poet did not disdain to take an occasional
suggestion for the improvement of his verse.</p>

<p>We recognize Wordsworth to-day as the most unequal of English poets.
There is little that is common to the inspired bard of <i>Tintern Abbey</i>,
the <i>Immortality Ode</i> and the nobler <i>Sonnets</i>, and the unsophisticated
scribe of <i>Peter Bell</i> and <i>The Idiot Boy</i>. Like Browning, he wrote too
much to write well at all times, and if both poets were capable of the
sublimest flights, they likewise descended to unimagined depths; but the
fault of Wordsworth was perhaps the greater, because his bathos was the
result of a deliberate and persistent attempt to enrich English poetry
with prosaically versified incidents drawn at length from homely rural
life.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span></p>

<p>The first part of Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i> was written in 1797 during
the brief period of inspiration that also gave us <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>
and <i>Kubla Khan</i>&mdash;in short, that small group of exquisite poems which in
themselves suffice to place Coleridge in the front rank of English
poets. The second part was written in 1800, after the author's return
from Germany. The fragment circulated widely in manuscript among
literary men, bewitched Scott and Byron into imitating its fascinating
rhythms, and, at Byron's suggestion, was finally published by Murray in
1816 with <i>Kubla Khan</i> and <i>The Pains of Sleep</i>. It is probable that the
high esteem in which these poems were held by Coleridge's literary
friends led him to expect a favorable reception at the hands of the
critics; hence his keen disappointment at the general tone of their
sarcastic analysis and their protests against the absurdity and
obscurity of the poems. The principal critiques on <i>Christabel</i>
were:&mdash;(1) <i>Edinburgh Rev.</i>, XXVII (58-67), which is here reprinted; (2)
<i>Monthly Rev.</i>, LXXXII, n.s. (22-25), reprinted in Stevenson's <i>Early
Reviews</i>; (3) <i>The Literary Panorama</i>, IV, n.s. (561-565); and (4)
<i>Anti-Jacobin Rev.</i>, L (632-636).</p>

<p>It is evident that Coleridge was eminently successful in the gentle art
of making enemies. We have seen that Southey's attack on the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i> was a direct result of his ill-will toward Coleridge; the
outrageous article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was written by William
Hazlitt under similar inspiration, and was followed by abusive papers in
<i>The Examiner</i> (1816, p.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> 743, and 1817, p. 236). There was no
justification for Hazlitt, and none has been attempted by his
biographers. Judged by its intrinsic merits, the Edinburgh article is
one of the most absurd reviews ever written by a critic of recognized
ability. Hazlitt followed the method of outlining the story by quotation
with interspersed sarcasm and ironical criticism. As a coarse boor might
crumple a delicate and beautifully wrought fabric to prove that it has
not the wearing qualities of a blacksmith's apron, Hazlitt seized upon
the ethereal story of <i>Christabel</i>, with its wealth of medi&aelig;val and
romantic imagery, and held up to ridicule the incidents that did not
conform to modern English conceptions of life. It requires no great art
to produce such a critique; the same method was applied to <i>Christabel</i>
with hardly less success by the anonymous hack of the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>.
Whatever may have been Hazlitt's motives, we cannot understand how a
critic of his unquestioned ability could quote with ridicule some of the
very finest lines of <i>Kubla Khan</i>, and expect his readers to concur with
his opinion. The lack of taste was more apparent because he quoted, with
qualified praise, six lines of no extraordinary merit from <i>Christabel</i>
and insisted, that with this one exception, there was not a couplet in
the whole poem that achieved the standard of a newspaper poetry-corner
or the effusions scratched by peripatetic bards on inn-windows. An
interesting discussion between Mr. Thomas Hutchinson and Col. Prideaux
concerning Hazlitt's responsibility for this and other critiques on
Coleridge in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> will be found in <i>Notes and Queries</i>
(Ninth Series), X, pp. 388, 429; XI, 170, 269.</p>

<p>The other reviews of <i>Christabel</i> were all unfavorable. Most extravagant
was the utterance of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, XLVI, p. 407, in 1818, when
it declared that the "poem of Christabel is only fit for the inmates of
Bedlam. We are not acquainted in the history of literature with so great
an insult offered to the public understanding as the publication of that
r[h]apsody of delirium."</p>

<p>Hazlitt's primitive remarks on the metre of <i>Christabel</i> are of little
interest. Coleridge was, of course, wrong in stating that his metre was
founded on a new principle. The irregularly four-stressed line occurs in
Spenser's <i>Shepherd's Calender</i> and can be traced back through the
halting tetrameters of Skelton. Coleridge himself alludes to this fact
in his note to his poem <i>The Raven</i>, and elsewhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Robert Southey</span></p>

<p><i>Madoc</i>, a ponderous quarto of over five hundred pages and issued at two
guineas, was published by Southey in 1805 as the second of that
long-forgotten series of interminable epics including <i>Thalaba</i>, <i>The
Curse of Kehama</i>, and <i>Roderick, Last of the Goths</i>. These huge unformed
productions were not poems, but metrical tales, written in a kind of
verse that could have flowed indefinitely from the author's pen. In
short, Southey was not a poet, and the whole bulk of his efforts in
verse, with but one or two exceptions, seems destined to oblivion. As
poet-laureate for thirty years and the associate of Wordsworth and
Coleridge in the "Lake School," Southey will, however, remain a figure
of some importance in the history of English poetry.</p>

<p>The review of <i>Madoc</i> reprinted from the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XLVIII
(113-122) for October, 1805, was written in the old style then fast
giving way to the sprightlier methods of the <i>Edinburgh</i>. Here we find a
style abounding in literary allusions and classical quotations, and
evincing a generally patronizing attitude toward the author under
discussion. Most readers will agree with the sentiments expressed by the
reviewer, who succeeded in making his article interesting without
descending to the depths of buffoonery. No apology is necessary for the
excision of the reviewer's unreasonably long extracts from the poem.
<i>Madoc</i> was also reviewed at great length in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> by
Francis Jeffrey.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Charles Lamb</span></p>

<p>Most of Lamb's earlier poetical productions appeared in conjunction with
the work of other poets. Four of his sonnets were printed with
Coleridge's <i>Poems on Various Subjects</i> (1796), and he was more fully
represented in <i>Poems by S.T. Coleridge. Second Edition</i>. <i>To which are
now added Poems by Charles Lamb and Charles Lloyd</i> (1797). In the
following year appeared <i>Blank Verse</i>, by Charles Lloyd and Charles
Lamb. For new and interesting material concerning the three poets, see
E.V. Lucas' <i>Charles Lamb and the Lloyds</i> (1899). Lloyd (1775-1839)
wrote melancholy verses and a sentimental, epistolary novel <i>Edmund
Oliver</i>, but nothing of permanent value. However, in 1798, he was almost
as well known as Coleridge, and was hailed in some quarters as a
promising poet.</p>

<p>The <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XXVII, n.s. (104-105), in September, 1798, published
the critique of <i>Blank Verse</i> which is here reprinted. Its principal
interest lies in the scant attention shown to Lamb, although the volume
contained his best poem&mdash;the tender <i>Old Familiar Faces</i>. Dr. Johnson's
characterization of blank-verse as "poetry to the eye" will be found at
the end of his <i>Life of Milton</i> as a quotation from "an ingenious
critic."</p>

<p>Lamb's drama, <i>John Woodvil</i> (1802), written in imitation of later
Elizabethan models, was a failure. It was unfavorably noticed in the
<i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XL, n.s., p. 442 and at greater length in the <i>Edinburgh
Rev.</i>, II, p. 90 ff.</p>

<p>Many years later (1830) Lamb prepared his collection of <i>Album-Verses</i>
at the request of his friend Edward Moxon, who had achieved some fame as
a poet and was enabled (by the generous aid of Samuel Rogers) to begin
his more lucrative career as a publisher. Three years after the
appearance of <i>Album-Verses</i>, he married Lamb's adopted daughter, Emma
Isola. The <i>Album-Verses</i>, like most of their kind, were a collection of
small value; the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1830 (441-442), consequently lost
no time in assailing them. The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 1830, p. 435, at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> time
the bitter rival of the <i>Gazette</i>, published a more favorable review,
and a few weeks later (p. 491) printed Southey's verses, <i>To Charles
Lamb, on the Reviewal of his Album-Verses in the Literary Gazette</i>,
together with a sharp commentary on the methods of the <i>Gazette</i>.
Several times during that year the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> assailed the system of
private puffery which was followed by the <i>Gazette</i> and eventually
caused its downfall. There is a reply to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in the <i>Literary
Gazette</i>, 1833, p. 772.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Walter Savage Landor</span></p>

<p>Landor was twenty-three when he published <i>Gebir</i> anonymously in
1798&mdash;the year of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>&mdash;and he lived until 1864. The
nine decades of his life covered an important period of literature. He
was nine years old when the great Johnson died, yet he lived to see the
best poetic achievements of Tennyson, Browning, and Arnold. However, he
did not live to see <i>Gebir</i> a popular poem. Southey gave it a favorable
welcome in the <i>Critical Review</i>, and became a life-long admirer of
Landor; but our brief notices reprinted from the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XXXI,
n.s., p. 206, and <i>British Critic</i>, XV, p. 190 of February, 1800,
represent more nearly the popular verdict. Both reviewers complain of
the obscurity of the poem, which, it will be remembered, had been
originally written in Latin, then translated and abridged.
Notwithstanding the fact that Landor declared himself amply repaid by
the praise of a few appreciative readers, he prepared a violent and
scornful reply to the <i>Monthly Review</i>, and would have published it but
for the sensible dissuasion of a friend. Some interesting extracts from
the letter are printed in Forster's <i>Life of Landor</i>, pp. (76-85). He
protested especially against the imputed plagiarisms from Milton and
gave ample evidence of the pugnacious spirit that brought him into
difficulties several times during his life. See also the <i>Imaginary
Conversation</i> between Archdeacon Hare and Walter Landor, wherein the
reception of <i>Gebir</i> is discussed and Southey's poetry is praised at the
expense of Wordsworth's. Landor's first publication, the <i>Poems</i> (1795)
was noticed in the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XXI, n.s., p. 253.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span></p>

<p>The successful series of metrical tales which Scott inaugurated with the
<i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> (1805) had for its second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> member the more
elaborate <i>Marmion</i> (1808). From the first, Scott's poems and romances
were favorably received by the reviews and usually noticed at great
length. There was always a story to outline and choice passages to
quote. As suggested in the Preface, these p&aelig;ans of praise are of
comparatively little interest to the student, and need hardly be cited
here in detail.</p>

<p>The critique of <i>Marmion</i>, written by Jeffrey for the <i>Edinburgh Rev.</i>,
XII (1-35), had the place of honor in the number for April, 1808. It was
chosen for the present reprints partly as a fitting example of Jeffrey's
fearlessness in expressing his opinions, and partly for its historic
interest as the article that contributed to Scott's rupture with the
Edinburghers and to his successful founding of a Tory rival in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>. Although the article has here been abridged to about
half of its original length by the omission of six hundred quoted lines
and a synopsis of the poem, it is still the longest of these reprints.
Jeffrey evidently felt that a detailed account of the story was
necessary in order to justify his strictures on the plot.</p>

<p>An author of those days could afford to ignore the decisions of the
critical monthlies, but the brilliant criticism and incisive diction of
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> carried weight and exerted far-reaching
influence. Jeffrey's article was practically the only dissonant note in
the chorus of praise that greeted <i>Marmion</i>, and Scott probably resented
the critic's attitude. Lockhart, in his admirable chapter on the
publication of <i>Marmion</i>, admits that "Jeffrey acquitted himself on this
occasion in a manner highly creditable to his courageous sense of duty."
The April number of the <i>Edinburgh</i> appeared shortly before a particular
day on which Jeffrey had engaged to dine with Scott. Fearing that under
the circumstances he might be an unwelcome guest, he sent the following
tactful note with the copy which was forwarded to the poet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Scott,&mdash;If I did not give you credit for more magnanimity than any
other of your irritable tribe, I should scarcely venture to put this
into your hands. As it is, I do it with no little solicitude, and
earnestly hope that it will make no difference in the friendship which
has hitherto subsisted between us. I have spoken of your poem exactly as
I think, and though I cannot reasonably suppose that you will be pleased
with everything I have said, it would mortify me very severely to
believe I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> given you pain. If you have any amity left for me, you
will not delay very long to tell me so. In the meantime, I am very
sincerely yours, F. Jeffrey."</p>

<p>There was but one course open to Scott; accordingly to Lockhart, "he
assured Mr. Jeffrey that the article had not disturbed his digestion,
though he hoped neither his booksellers nor the public would agree with
the opinions it expressed, and begged he would come to dinner at the
hour previously appointed. Mr. Jeffrey appeared accordingly, and was
received by his host with the frankest cordiality, but had the
mortification to observe that the mistress of the house, though
perfectly polite, was not quite so easy with him as usual. She, too,
behaved herself with exemplary civility during the dinner, but could not
help saying, in her broken English, when her guest was departing, 'Well,
good night, Mr. Jeffrey. Dey tell me you have abused Scott in de Review,
and I hope Mr. Constable has paid <i>you</i> very well for writing it.'"</p>

<p>Jeffrey's article apparently had little influence on the sale of
<i>Marmion</i>, which reached eight editions (25,000 copies) in three years.
In October, 1808, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> published an appreciative
review of Scott's edition of Dryden, and afterwards received with favor
the later poems and the principal Waverley Novels.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_78">78</a>. <i>Mr. Thomas Inkle</i>. The story of Inkle and Yarico was related by
Steele in no. 11 of the <i>Spectator</i>. It was afterwards dramatized (1787)
by George Colman.</p>

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Lord Byron</span></p>

<p>The twentieth number of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> contained Jeffrey's long
article on Wordsworth's <i>Poems</i> (1807); the twenty-second contained his
review of Scott's <i>Marmion</i>; and the twenty-first (January, 1808)
contained a still more famous critique, long attributed to Jeffrey&mdash;the
review of Byron's <i>Hours of Idleness</i> (1807). It is reprinted from
<i>Edinburgh Rev.</i>, XI (285-289) in Stevenson's <i>Early Reviews</i> and forms
Appendix II of R.E. Prothero's edition of Byron's <i>Letters and
Journals</i>. We know definitely that the article was written by Henry
Brougham. (See Prothero, op. cit., II, p. 397, and Sir M.E. Grant Duff's
<i>Notes from a Diary</i>, II, p. 189.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly within the province of literary criticism to deal with
hypothetical conditions in authors' lives; but it is at least a matter
of some interest to conjecture whether Byron would have become a great
poet if this stinging review had not been published. It is evident that
the <i>Hours of Idleness</i> gave few signs of promise, and the poet, fully
intent upon a political career, himself expressed his intention of
abandoning the muse. Many an educated Englishman has published such a
volume of <i>Juvenilia</i> and sinned no more. But a nature like Byron's
could not overlook the effrontery of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. The
proud-spirited poet was evidently far more incensed by the patronizing
tone of the article than by its strictures: what could be more galling
than the reiterated references to the "noble minor," or the withering
contempt that characterized a particular poem as "the thing in page 79"?
Many years later, Byron wrote to Shelley:&mdash;"I recollect the effect on me
of the <i>Edinburgh</i> on my first poem; it was rage, and resistance, and
redress&mdash;but not despondency nor despair." (Prothero, V, p. 267.)</p>

<p>There was method in Byron's "rage and resistance and redress." For more
than a year he labored upon a satire which he had begun even before the
appearance of the <i>Edinburgh</i> article. (See letter of October 26, 1807,
in <i>Letters</i>, ed. Prothero, I, p. 147.) In the spring of 1809, <i>English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i> was given anonymously to the world. The
publication of this vigorous satire virtually decided Byron's career.
Not only did he abuse Jeffrey, whom he believed responsible for the
offending critique, but he flung defiance in the face of almost all his
literary contemporaries. The authorship of the satire was soon apparent,
and in a flippant note to the second edition, Byron became still more
abusive toward Jeffrey and his "dirty pack," and declared that he was
ready to give satisfaction to all who sought it. A few years later he
regretted his rashness in assailing the authors of his time. He also
learned of the injustice done to Jeffrey and had ample reason to feel
embarrassed by the tone of the eight reviews of his poems that Jeffrey
did write for the <i>Edinburgh</i>. (See the list in Prothero, II, p. 248.)
In <i>Don Juan</i> (canto X, xvi), he made the following retraction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And all our little feuds, at least all <i>mine</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dear Jeffrey, once my most redoubted foe<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To make such puppets of us things below),<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Your face&mdash;but you have acted, on the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most nobly; and I own it from my soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other reviews of <i>Hours of Idleness</i> are of little interest. The
<i>Monthly</i> and the <i>Critical</i> both praised the book; the <i>Literary
Panorama</i>, III, p. 273, said the author was no imbecile, but an
incautious writer.</p>

<h4><i>Childe Harold</i></h4>

<p>Shortly after the appearance of the second edition of <i>English Bards and
Scotch Reviewers</i>, Byron left England and travelled through the East, at
the same time leisurely composing the first two cantos of <i>Childe
Harold's Pilgrimage</i>. Their publication in 1812 placed him at the head
of the popular poets of the day. Henceforth the reviews gave extensive
notices to all his productions. (For references, see J.P. Anderson's
bibliography appended to Hon. Roden Noel's <i>Life of Byron</i>.) <i>Childe
Harold</i> was reviewed in the <i>Edinburgh Rev.</i>, XIX (466-477), by Jeffrey;
in the <i>Quarterly</i>, VII (180-200), by George Ellis; in the <i>British
Review</i>, III (275-302); and <i>Eclectic Review</i>, XV (630-641).</p>

<p>The article here reprinted from the <i>Christian Observer</i>, XI (376-386),
of June, 1812, is of special interest as an early protest from
conservative, religious circles against the immoral and irreverent tone
of Byron's poetry. As literary criticism, it is almost worthless, in
spite of the elaborate allusions and quotations with which the
critic&mdash;evidently a survivor of the old school&mdash;has interlarded his
remarks. Little can be said in defense of an article which insists that
the chief end of poetry is to be agreeably didactic and which (in 1812)
cites Southey as the greatest of living poets. However, it probably
represents the attitude of a large number of worthy people of the time,
who recognized that Byron had genius, and wished to see him exercise his
powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> with due regard for the proprieties of civilized life. As
Byron's offences grew more flagrant in his later poems, the criticisms
in the conservative reviews became more vehement. For Byron's
controversy with the <i>British Review</i>, which he facetiously dubbed "my
grandmother's review" in <i>Don Juan</i>, see Prothero, IV, pp. (346-347),

<p>It is doubtful whether any other poet was so widely and so continuously
assailed in the reviews as Shelley. Circumstances have made certain
critiques on Byron, Keats, and others more widely known, but nowhere
else do we find the persistent stream of abuse that followed in the wake
of Shelley's publications. The <i>Blackwood</i> articles were usually most
scathing, and those of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> were not far behind.
Fortunately, the poet spent most of his time in Italy and thus remained
in ignorance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> great majority of these spiteful attacks in the
less important periodicals.</p>

<p><i>Alastor</i>, which appeared in 1816, attracted comparatively little
attention. The tone of the brief notice reprinted from the <i>Monthly
Rev.</i>, LXXIX, n.s., p. 433, shows that the poet was as yet unknown to
the critics. <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, VI (148-154), gave a longer and, on
the whole, more favorable account of the poem. In the same year, Leigh
Hunt published his <i>Story of Rimini</i>, most noteworthy for its graceful
rhythmical structure in the unrestricted couplets of Chaucer. This
departure from the polished heroics of Pope, which were ill-adapted to
narrative subjects in spite of his successful translation of Homer, was
hailed with delight by the younger poets. Shelley imitated the measure
in his <i>Julian</i> and <i>Maddalo</i>, and Keats did likewise in <i>Lamia</i> and
<i>Endymion</i>. Hunt was soon recognized by the critics as the leader of a
group of liberals whom they conveniently classified as the Cockney
School. Shelley's ill-treatment at the hands of the reviewers dates from
his association with this coterie. His <i>Revolt of Islam</i> (1818) was
assailed by John Taylor Coleridge in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, XXI
(460-471). <i>The Cenci</i> was condemned as a horrible literary monstrosity
by the scandalized critics of the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>, XCIV, n.s. (161-168);
the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1820 (209-10); and the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>,
XIII (550-553). The review here reprinted from the <i>London Mag.</i>, I
(401-405), is comparatively mild in its censure.</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that the death of Keats would have ensured
at least a respectful consideration for Shelley's lament, <i>Adonais</i>
(1821); but the callous critics were by no means abashed. The outrageous
article in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> of December 8, 1821, pp. (772-773), is
one of the unpardonable errors of literary criticism; but it sinks into
insignificance beside the brutal, unquotable review which <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> permitted to appear in its pages. In the same year Shelley's
youthful poetical indiscretion, <i>Queen Mab</i>, which he himself called
"villainous trash," was published under circumstances beyond his
control, and forthwith the readers of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> were
regaled with ten columns of foul abuse from the pen of a critic who
declared that he was driven almost speechless by the sentiments
expressed in the poem. Well could the heartless reviewer of <i>Adonais</i>
write:&mdash;"If criticism killed the disciples of that [the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> Cockney]

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">John Keats</span></p>

<p>The history of English poetry offers no more interesting case between
poet and critic than that of John Keats. The imputed influence of a
savage critique in hastening the death of the poet has given the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> an unenviable notoriety which clings in spite of the
efforts of scholars to establish the truth. To many students, Keats,
<i>Endymion</i>, and <i>Quarterly</i> are practically connotative terms; and this
is a direct result of the righteous but misguided indignation of
Shelley&mdash;misguided because his information was incomplete and the more
guilty party escaped, thus inflicting upon the <i>Quarterly</i> the brunt of
the opprobrium of which far more than half should be accredited to
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Endymion</i> was published in April, 1818. One of the publishers (Taylor
and Hessey) requested Gifford, then editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, to
treat the poem with indulgence. This indiscreet move probably actuated
Gifford to provide a severe critique; at any rate, in the belated April
number of the <i>Quarterly</i>, XIX (204-208), which was not issued until
September, appeared the famous review. A persistent error, which has
crept into W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>M. Rossetti's <i>Life of Keats</i>, into Anderson's
bibliography, and even into the article on Gifford in the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, attributes this article to Gifford himself; but it
is known to be the work of John Wilson Croker. (See the article on
Croker in <i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i> From the article on John Murray (<i>ibid.</i>)
we learn that Gifford was not wholly responsible for a single article in
the <i>Quarterly</i>.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, III (519-524) had made <i>Endymion</i> the
text of its fourth infamous tirade against the Cockney School of Poetry.
The signature "Z" was appended to all the articles, but the critic's
identity has not yet been discovered. Leigh Hunt thought it was Walter
Scott, Haydon suspected the actor Terry, but it is more probable that
the honor belongs to John Gibson Lockhart. One account attributes the
entire series to Lockhart; another attributes the series to Wilson, but
holds Lockhart responsible for the <i>Endymion</i> article. Mr. Andrew Lang,
in his <i>Life and Letters of Lockhart</i>, dismissed the matter by saying
that he did not know who wrote the article.</p>

<p>The <i>Quarterly</i> critique was reprinted in Stevenson's <i>Early Reviews</i>,
in Rossetti's <i>Life of Keats</i>, in Buxton Forman's edition of Keats'
<i>Poetical Works</i> (Appendix V) and elsewhere. From a critical point of
view, it is, as Forman terms it, a "curiously unimportant production."
The student will at once question its power to cause distress in the
mind of the poet; as for malignant severity, there are several reviews
among the present reprints that put the brief <i>Quarterly</i> article to
shame. When we turn to what Swinburne calls the "obscener insolence" of
the <i>Blackwood</i> article, we find an unrestrained torrent of abuse
against both Hunt and Keats that amply justified Landor's subsequent
allusions to the <i>Blackguard's Magazine</i>. The <i>Quarterly</i> critique was
captious and ill-tempered; but the <i>Blackwood</i> article was a personal
insult.</p>

<p>It is impossible to consider in detail the vexed question of the
influence which these reviews had upon Keats. In Mr. W.M. Rossetti's
<i>Life of Keats</i>, pp. (83-106) there is a full discussion of the evidence
on the subject. Within a few months after the appearance of the
articles, Keats wrote:&mdash;"Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on
the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic
of his own works. My own domestic criticism has given me pain without
comparison beyond what <i>Blackwood</i> or <i>The Quarterly</i> could possibly
inflict." Some weeks later he wrote that the <i>Quarterly</i> article had
only served to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> make him more prominent among bookmen. After some time
he expressed himself less confidently and deprecated the growing power
of the reviews, but there is no evidence that he fretted over the
critiques. Haydon tells us that Keats was morbid and silent for hours at
a time; but it is quite likely that the consciousness of his physical
affliction&mdash;hereditary consumption&mdash;was oppressing his mind. His death
occurred on February 23, 1821&mdash;about two and a half years after the
appearance of the <i>Endymion</i> critiques.</p>

<p>Shelley had gone to Italy before the reviews were published. He heard of
the <i>Quarterly</i> article, but knew nothing of <i>Blackwood's</i> while writing
<i>Adonais</i>; hence in both poem and preface, the former review is charged
with having caused Keats' death. Shelley declared that Keats' agitation
over the review ended in the rupture of a blood vessel in the lungs with
an ensuing rapid consumption. These statements, which Shelley must have
had indirectly, have not been substantiated. We are forced to the
conclusion now generally accepted&mdash;that Keats, although sensitive to
personal ridicule, was superior to the stings of review criticism and
that the distressing events of the last year of his life were sufficient
to assure the early triumph of the inherent and unconquerable disease.</p>

composed of Londoners of the middle-class, supposedly ill-bred and
imperfectly educated. The critics took special delight in dwelling upon
the humble origin of the Cockneys, their lack of university training,
and especially their dependence on translations for their knowledge of

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Alfred Lord Tennyson</span></p>

<p>Tennyson's first poetical efforts, which appeared in <i>Poems by Two
Brothers</i> (1827) attracted little critical attention. His prize-poem,
<i>Timbuctoo</i> (1829) received the interesting notice here reprinted from
the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (p. 456) of July 22, 1829. <i>Timbuctoo</i> was printed in the
<i>Cambridge Chronicle</i> (July 10, 1829); in the <i>Prolusiones Academic&aelig;</i>
(1829); and several times in <i>Cambridge Prize-Poems</i>. The use of heroic
metre in prize-poems was traditional; hence the award was an enviable
tribute to the blank-verse of <i>Timbuctoo</i>.</p>

<p>Tennyson's success was emphasized by the remarkable series of reviews
that greeted his earliest volumes of poems. The <i>Poems, chiefly Lyrical</i>
(1830) were welcomed by Sir John Bowring in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, by
Leigh Hunt in the <i>Tatler</i>, by Arthur Hallam in the <i>Englishman's
Magazine</i>, and by John Wilson in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. The <i>Poems</i>
(1833) were reviewed by W.J. Fox in the <i>Monthly Repository</i>, and by
John Stuart Mill in the <i>Westminster Review</i>. This array of names was
indeed a tribute to the poet; but the unfavorable review, was, as usual,
most significant. The article written by Lockhart for the <i>Quarterly
Rev.</i>, XLIX (81-97), has been characterized as "silly and brutal," but
it was neither. Tennyson's fame is secure; we can at least be just to
his early reviewer. It is true that the poet winced under the lash and
that ten years elapsed before his next volume of collected poems
appeared; but Canon Ainger is surely in error when he holds the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> mainly responsible for this long silence. The rich
measure of praise elsewhere bestowed upon the volume would leave us no
alternative but the conclusion that Tennyson was childish enough to
maintain his silence for a decade because Lockhart took liberties with
his poems instead of joining the chorus of adulation. We know that there
were other and stronger reasons for Tennyson's silence and we also know
that the effect of Lockhart's article was decidedly salutary. When the
next collection of <i>Poems</i> (1842) did appear, the shorter pieces
ridiculed by Lockhart were omitted, and the derided passages in the
longer poems were altered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>We may, without conscientious scruples, take Mr. Andrew Lang's advice,
and enjoy a laugh over Lockhart's performance. Its mock appreciations
are, perhaps, far-fetched at times; but there are enough effective
passages to give zest to the article. It has been said in all
seriousness that Lockhart failed to appreciate the beauty of most of
Tennyson's lines, and that he confined his remarks to the most
assailable passages. Surely, when a critic undertakes to write a
mock-appreciation, he will not quote the best verses, to the detriment
of his plan. The poet must see to it that his volume does not contain
enough absurdities to form a sufficient basis for such an article. There
is a striking contrast to the humor of Lockhart in the little-known
review of the same volume by the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1833, pp.
(772-774). The latter seized upon some crudities that had escaped the
<i>Quarterly's</i> notice, and, with characteristic brutality, decided that
the poet was insane and needed a low diet and a cell.</p>

<p>Although the reception accorded to <i>Poems</i> (1842) was generally
favorable, the publication of <i>The Princess</i> in 1847 afforded the
critics another opportunity to lament Tennyson's inequalities. The
spirit of the review of <i>The Princess</i> here reprinted from the <i>Literary
Gazette</i> of August 8, 1848, is practically identical with that of the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> on January 6, 1848, but specifies more clearly the critic's
objections to the medley. It is noteworthy that Lord Tennyson made
extensive changes in subsequent editions of <i>The Princess</i>, but left
unaltered all of the passages to which the <i>Literary Gazette</i> took
exception. The beautiful threnody <i>In Memoriam</i> (1850) and Tennyson's
elevation to the laureateship in the same year established his position
as the leading poet of the time; but the appearance of <i>Maud</i> in 1856
proved to be a temporary check to his popularity. A few personal friends
admired it and praised its fine lyrics; but as a dramatic narrative it
failed to please the reviews. The most interesting of the critiques
(unfortunately too long to be reprinted here) appeared in <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, XLI (311-321), of September, 1855,&mdash;a forcible, well-written
article, which, incidentally, shows how much the magazine had improved
in respectability since the days of the lampooners of Byron, Shelley,
and Keats. The authorship of the article has not been disclosed, but we
know that W.E. Aytoun asked permission of the proprietor to review
Tennyson's <i>Maud</i>. (See Mrs. Oliphant's <i>William Blackwood and his
Sons</i>.) The publication of the <i>Idylls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> of the King</i> (1859), turned the
tide more strongly than before in Tennyson's favor, and subsequent
fault-finding on the part of the critics was confined largely to his
dramas.</p>

quoted lines state. Nor does Tennyson "ambition a bolder metamorphosis"
than his predecessors. Anacreon (Ode XXII) wishes to be a stream, as
well as a mirror, a robe, a pair of sandals and sundry other articles.

<p class="bigcenter"><span class="smcap">Robert Browning</span></p>

<p>The reviews of Browning's poems are singularly uninteresting from a
historical standpoint. There is usually a protest against the obscurity
of the poetry and a plea that the author should make better use of his
manifest genius. For details concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> these reviews, see the
bibliography of Browning in Nicoll and Wise's <i>Literary Anecdotes of the
Nineteenth Century</i>. The list there given is extensive, but does not
include several of the reviews mentioned below.</p>

<p>The early poems were so abstruse that the critics were unable to make
sport of them as they did in the case of Wordsworth, Byron, Tennyson,
and the rest; and when Browning finally deigned to write within range of
the average human intellect, that particular style of reviewing had lost
favor. His earliest publication, <i>Pauline</i> (1832) was well received by
W.J. Fox in <i>Monthly Repository</i>, and in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. <i>Tait's
Edinburgh Magazine</i> called it a "piece of pure bewilderment." See also
the brief notice in the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1833, p. 183. <i>Paracelsus</i>
(1835) had a similar experience; the reprint from the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 1835,
p. 640, is fairly characteristic of the rest, among which are the
articles in the <i>Monthly Repository</i>, 1835, p. 716; the <i>Christian
Remembrancer</i>, XX, p. 346, and the reviews written by John Forster for
the <i>Examiner</i>, 1835, p. 563, and the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, XLVI
(289-308).</p>

<p>Neither the favorable review of <i>Sordello</i> (1840) in the <i>Monthly Rev.</i>,
1840, II, p. 149, nor the partly appreciative article in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
1840, p. 431, seems to warrant the well-known anecdotes relating the
difficulties of Douglas Jerrold and Tennyson in attempting to understand
that poem. The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> gave the poet sound advice, especially in
regard to the intentional obscurity of his meaning. That this admonition
was futile may be gathered from the <i>Saturday Review's</i> article (I, p.
69) on <i>Men and Women</i> (1855) published fifteen years after <i>Sordello</i>.
The critic reverted to the earlier style, and produced one of the most
readable reviews of Browning. Whatever may be the final verdict yet to
be passed upon Browning's poetic achievement, the fact remains that the
contemporary reviews from first to last deplored in his work a
deliberate obscurity which was wholly unwarranted and which precluded
the universal appeal that is essential to a poet's greatness.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_189">189</a>. <i>Della Crusca of Sentimentalism</i>. Robert Merry (1755-1798) under
the name Della Crusca became the leader of a set of poetasters who
flourished during the poetic dearth at the end of the eighteenth century
and poured forth their rubbish until William Gifford exposed their
follies in his satires <i>The Baviad</i> (1794) and <i>The M&aelig;viad</i> (1795).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Page_189">189</a>. <i>Alexander Smith</i>. A Scotch poet (1830-1867).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_189">189</a>. <i>Mystic of Bailey</i>. Philip James Bailey (1816-1902), best known as
the author of <i>Festus</i>, published <i>The Mystic</i> in 1855.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_192">192</a>. <i>Hudibras Butler, etc.</i> Samuel Butler, author of <i>Hudibras</i>
(1663-78); Richard H. Barham, author of the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i> (1840);
and Thomas Hood, author of <i>Whims and Oddities</i> (1826-27). These poets
are cited by the reviewer for their skill with unusual metres and
difficult rhymes.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
